Germany,[e] officially the Federal Republic of Germany,[f] is a country in Central Europe. It lies between the Baltic and North Sea to the north and the Alps to the south. Its sixteen constituent states have a total population of over 82 million in an area of 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi), making it the most populous member state of the European Union. It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.

Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the Lower Paleolithic, with various tribes inhabiting it from the Neolithic onward, chiefly the Celts. Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.

Formal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation, which became the German Empire in 1871. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the Weimar Republic. The Nazi rise to power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. In 1949, after the war and a period of Allied occupation, Germany was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Berlin continued its de jure Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of the communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990.

Germany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country, it offers social security, a universal health care system, and tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, Council of Europe, NATO and OECD, and a founding member of the European Union, G7 and G20. It has the third-highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 54, of which 51 are cultural.

Etymology
Further information: Names of Germany, Germani, and Germania
The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ('the German lands'), is derived from deutsch (cf. Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc 'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from *þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewtéh₂- 'people', from which the word Teutons also originates.[13]

History

Prehistory
Main articles: Linear Pottery culture, Unetice culture, Urnfield culture, and Celts
Pre-human ancestors, the Danuvius guggenmosi, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[14] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 41,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19][20] The Nebra sky disk, created during the European Bronze Age, has been attributed to a German site.[21]

Germanic tribes, Roman frontier and the Frankish Empire
Main articles: Jastorf culture, Germanic peoples, Germania, Migration Period, and Frankish Realm

The Germanic peoples are thought to have emerged from the Jastorf culture during the Nordic Bronze Age or early Iron Age.[22][23] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[24][25] Southern Germany was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider La Tène culture. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.[26]

Under Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[27] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[28] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[29][30][31]

Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[32] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria. Areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[29]

East Francia and the Holy Roman Empire
Main articles: East Francia and Holy Roman Empire

East Francia in 843

Martin Luther, born in Eisleben in 1483, challenged the indulgences of the Catholic Church, giving rise to the Reformation and Protestantism.
Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[33] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[33] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies.[34] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.[35]

Under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (Ostsiedlung).[36] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[37] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–1350.[38] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[39]

Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[40] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardization of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the "Evangelical" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (cuius regio, eius religio).[41] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[42][43]

The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates.[42] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[44] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[45][46]

From 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[47][48] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[49]

German Confederation and Empire
Main articles: German question, German Confederation, Unification of Germany, German Empire, and German colonial empire

The German Confederation in 1815
Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[50][51] The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[52] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[53]


Berlin Palace, the main residence of the House of Hohenzollern
King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[54][55]

In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[55] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[56] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[57] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[58] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[59] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[60][61] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[61]

The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[62] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[63] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[64]

Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany
Main articles: Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany

Adolf Hitler, dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945

A map of German-occupied Europe in 1942 during World War II with areas controlled by the German Reich shown in bold black
On 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[65] Communists briefly seized power in Bavaria and a few larger cities, while conservative elements failed to overthrow the central government in the 1920 Kapp Putsch. The occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and a period of hyperinflation followed. A plan to restructure Germany's war reparations and the creation of a new currency in 1924 helped stabilise the government and ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[66][67][68]

The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929, and by 1932 the unemployment rate had risen to 24%.[69] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after the election of July 1932, and President Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.[70] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights, and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[71][72] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[73] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[74] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the Autobahn.[75]

In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[76] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[77] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[78] Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[79]

In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[80] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[81] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[82] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[81][83] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[84][85]

In what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. The regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[86] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[87] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[88][84] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[89] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[90] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[91]

East and West Germany
Main articles: History of Germany (1945–1990), Allied-occupied Germany, West Germany, and East Germany

The Berlin Wall during its fall in 1989 and the Brandenburg Gate (background) was one of the first developments in the end of the Cold War, leading ultimately to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
After Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies de jure abolished the German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[92] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[93]

West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a "social market economy". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[94] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) beginning in the early 1950s.[95] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[96] On 1 January 1957, the Saarland joined West Germany.[97]

East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[98] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[99] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[100]

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.[101] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the Two Plus Four Treaty under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[102] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and Die Wende ("the turning point").[103]

Reunified Germany and the European Union
Main articles: German reunification and History of Germany since 1990
United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[104] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[105] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[106][107]

Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[108] and co-founding the eurozone.[109] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[110][111]

In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[112] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[113] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[114]

Geography
Main article: Geography of Germany

A physical map of Germany
Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe.[4] It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and Czechia to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi).[6] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[115]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4]

Climate
Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[116]

From February 2019 – 2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[117] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[118] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[119]

Biodiversity

The territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[120] As of 2016, 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[121]

Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[122] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[123] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[124]

The 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[125] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[126] and 105 nature parks.[127] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[128] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[129]

Politics

Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[130]

The president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[131] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[4] The chancellor, currently Olaf Scholz, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[4]

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[132][133]

Constituent states
Main articles: States of Germany, Federalism in Germany, and List of current Minister-presidents of the German federal states
Germany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as Länder.[134] Each state (Land) has its own constitution,[135] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[134] As of 2017, Germany is divided into 401 districts (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[136]Law
Main articles: Law of Germany, Judiciary of Germany, and Law enforcement in Germany
Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[140] The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[141] Germany's specialized supreme court system includes the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice for civil and criminal cases, along with the Federal Labour Court, Federal Social Court, Federal Fiscal Court, and Federal Administrative Court for other matters.[142]

Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[143] With the exceptions of petty crimes, tried by a single professional judge, and of serious political crimes, all charges are adjudicated by mixed tribunals where lay judges (Schöffen) and professional judges preside together.[144][145]

As of 2016, Germany's murder rate stood at a low of 1.18 murders per 100,000.[146] In 2018, the overall crime rate fell to its lowest since 1992.[147]

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017, and LGBT rights are generally protected in the nation.[148]

Foreign relations
Main article: Foreign relations of Germany

Germany hosted the 2022 G7 summit at Schloss Elmau in Bavaria.
Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[149] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[150] Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G7, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[151][152][153] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[154] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism.

[155] After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a "strategic partnership" in which energy development became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[156][157]

Germany's development policy functions as a distinct sector within its foreign policy framework. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[158] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.[159]

Military
Main article: Bundeswehr

A German TPz Fuchs armoured personnel carrier
Germany's military, the Bundeswehr (Federal Defence), is organised into the Heer (Army and special forces KSK), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Cyber- und Informationsraum (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches.[160] In absolute terms, German military spending in 2023 was the seventh-highest in the world.[161] In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[162][163] In 2023, military spending according to NATO criteria amounted to $73.1 billion, or 1.64% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2024, Germany reported $97.7 billion to NATO, exceeding the NATO target of 2% at 2.12% of GDP.[164]

As of May 2024, the Bundeswehr has a strength of 180,215 active soldiers and 80,761 civilians.[165] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[166] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[167][168] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[169] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany was the fifth-largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2019 to 2023.[170]

In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[171] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term "defence" has been defined not only to include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017, the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[172][173]

Germany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a low level of corruption,[175] and a high level of innovation.[176] It is the world's third-largest exporter and third-largest importer,[4] and has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP, which is also the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP[177] and sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.[178] Its GDP per capita measured in purchasing power standards amounts to 121% of the EU27 average.[179] The country's service sector contributes approximately 69% of the total GDP, industry 31%—with Germany having the largest manufacturing sector in Europe—and agriculture 1% as of 2017.[4] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 3.2% as of January 2020, which is the fourth-lowest in the EU.[180]

Germany is part of the European single market which represents more than 450 million consumers.[181] In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the eurozone economy according to the International Monetary Fund.[182] Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro, in 2002.[183] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is based in Frankfurt.[184][174]

The automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,[185] and is the sixth-largest by production as of 2021. Germany is home to Volkswagen Group, the world's second-largest automotive manufacturer by vehicle production.[186]

With its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[202] Its road network is among the densest in Europe.[203] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no general federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[204] The Intercity Express or ICE train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).[205] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport and Berlin Brandenburg Airport.[206] The Port of Hamburg is the third-busiest port in Europe and one of the twenty largest container ports in the world.[207]


Windmills behind Lisberg Castle
In 2019, Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[208] All nuclear power plants were phased out in 2023.[209] Germany meets its power demands using 40% renewable sources,[210] and has been called an "early leader" in solar panels and offshore wind.[211] The country is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, and water management.[212][213][214] Germany's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world—at around 65%.[215] The country's greenhouse gas emissions per capita were the ninth-highest in the EU in 2018, but these numbers have been trending downward.[216][217] The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy, with the country being called "the world's first major renewable energy economy".[218][219][211] Germany has reduced its primary energy consumption by 11% between 1990 and 2015[220] and set itself goals of reducing it by 30% by 2030 and by 50% by 2050.[221]

Demographics
Main articles: Demographics of Germany and Germans
With a population of 84.7 million according to the 2023 German census,[226] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia,[4][g] and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (590 inhabitants/sq mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[4]

Four sizeable groups of people are referred to as national minorities because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[228] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[228] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.[228]

After the United States, Germany is the second-most popular immigration destination in the world.[229] In 2015, following the 2015 refugee crisis, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[230] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases;[231] for example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, meaning over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[232] As of 2019, Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[233] In 2022, there were 23.8 million people, 28.7 percent of the total population, who had a migration background.[234]

Germany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.[235]According to the 2022 census, Christianity is the largest religion at 49.7% of the population; 23.1% identified as Protestant and 25.1% as Catholic.[237]

Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[238] In the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[239] In 2019, there were an estimated 5.3–5.6 million Muslims with a migrant background[h] (6.4–6.7% of the population), in addition to an unknown number of Muslims without a migrant background.[240] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevis from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions each comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.[238]

In 2011, formal members of the Jewish community represented no more than 0.2% of the total German population, and 60% of them resided in Berlin.[241] An estimated 80 to 90 percent of these Jews in Germany are Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who came to Germany from the 1980s onwards.[242][243]

A study in 2023 estimated that 46.2% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination.[244] Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[245][246]

Languages
Main articles: German language and Languages of Germany
German is the official and predominantly spoken language in Germany.[247] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission, alongside English and French.[248] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[249]

Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romani, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, Italian, Greek, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian and other Balkan languages, as well as Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[247]

Education
Main article: Education in Germany

Heidelberg University, Germany's oldest institution of higher learning and generally considered one of its most renowned
Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[250] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[251] A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[250] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[252]

Most of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[253] The general requirement for attending university is the Abitur. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[254] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386), Leipzig University (established in 1409) and the University of Rostock (established in 1419) being the oldest.[255] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[256][257] In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence.

Health
Main article: Healthcare in Germany

The Hospital of the Holy Spirit in Lübeck, established in 1286, is a precursor to modern hospitals.[258]
Germany's system of hospitals, called Krankenhäuser, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[259] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013.[260] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[261]

Germany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births). In 2019, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[262] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[263]

Culture
Main article: Culture of Germany

Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular, and its scientists, writers and philosophers have played a significant role in the development of Western thought.[264] Global opinion polls from the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.[265][266]

Germany is well known for such folk festivals as the Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[267][268] As of 2024, UNESCO inscribed 54 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[269] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day).[270]

Music

Ludwig van Beethoven, one of the most famed composers of classical music, was born in Bonn in 1770.
German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[271]

In 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and fourth-largest in the world.[272] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[273] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).[274]

German painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.[275]

German designers became early leaders of modern product design.[276] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.[277]

Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[275] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[278] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[275] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.[279] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.[280]

Literature and philosophy
Main articles: German literature and German philosophy

Brothers Grimm, who collected popular German folk tales and published them in a collection
German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[281] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[282]

Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll, and Günter Grass.[283] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[284] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[285] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.[286]

German philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; and the development of the Frankfurt School have all been very influential.[287]

Media

Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam
The largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are Bertelsmann, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with over 38 million TV households as of 2012.[288] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.[289] There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio and the public Deutsche Welle is the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.[289] Germany's print market of newspapers and magazines is the largest in Europe.[289] The papers with the highest circulation are Bild, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt.[289] The largest magazines include ADAC Motorwelt and Der Spiegel.[289] Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.[290] The Gamescom is the world's largest gaming convention.[291]

German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Trümmerfilm (rubble film). East German film was dominated by the state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the Heimatfilm ("homeland film").[292] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.

The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ("Oscar") went to the German production The Tin Drum (Die Blechtrommel) in 1979, to Nowhere in Africa (Nirgendwo in Afrika) in 2002, and to The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as "Berlinale", awarding the "Golden Bear" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The "Lolas" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.[293]

Cuisine

German cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities, including with the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia, Switzerland, and Austria. International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine, and doner kebab are also popular.

Bread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen).[294] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[295] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.[296]

The national alcoholic drink is beer.[297] German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[298] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[299] Wine has become popular in many parts of the country, especially close to German wine regions.[300] In 2019, Germany was the ninth-largest wine producer in the world.[301]

The 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.[302]

Sports
Main article: Sport in Germany

The German national football team after winning the FIFA World Cup for the fourth time in 2014
Football is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide,[303] and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second-highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.[304] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014,[305] the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996,[306] and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.[307]

Germany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13 times (as of April 2024).[308] The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships.[309] Sebastian Vettel is also among the most successful Formula One drivers of all time.[310]

German athletes historically have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count when combining East and West German medals prior to German reunification.[311] In 1936 Berlin hosted the Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.[312][313]

45 Most Asked Questions About Studying in Germany
1. Why choose Germany to study in as a foreign student?
Well, for starters, you’ll get first-class education (German universities are among the highest ranking in the world – right below a few of the American Ivy League and prestigious British universities) and a formal degree to show for it, that is recognized all over the world.

On top of that, the guiding principle of the German higher education being ‘The Unity of Teaching and Research’ (also the cornerstone of what is referred to as the ‘dual education system’), there is strong emphasis on ‘apprenticeship’ and hands-on involvement on the part of the student, in both the practical application of a large part of what gets learned theoretically and in researching novel ways of problem-solving (at many universities and ‘Fachhochschulen’ access to cutting-edge research facilities is available).

Finally, Germany is an important country and culture, so every international student stands to benefit greatly from familiarity with it (to say nothing of the ton of fun they are certain to have in the process).

2. What exactly is ‘Studienkolleg’?
It is a one-year preparatory course which has to be joined by individual candidates who wish to study at a German higher education institution but whose school leaving diploma is deemed insufficient to apply for a degree program.

The course covers full-time education in the subjects of a degree program as well as the German language, for five days a week. A passing score on the final Assessment Examination qualifies you to apply for a degree program that is suitable for you at any German university.

3. Can I study in Germany in English language?
Yes. There’s plenty of International Degree Courses taught in English (in the first semesters, at any rate) for students whose command of the German language isn’t sufficiently good to warrant their studying be done entirely in German. Both before and during the program there are German language courses offered. A large number of postgraduate courses (Master’s and Ph.D.) are designed and taught entirely in English.

Go to https://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programs/de/ and select “English” from the field “Course Language” to find all programs in English!

4. What exactly are the International Degree Courses?
International Degree Courses have been introduced by institutions of higher education in Germany with the express aim of facilitating the process whereby international student applicants realize their educational objectives in Germany. The medium of instruction is primarily English, with gradually increasing usage of German.

These courses, which have been designed to high academic standards and are available to not only international but German students as well, cover both undergraduate (6 to 8 semesters resulting with a Bachelors degree) and postgraduate (3 to 5 semesters resulting with a Masters degree – in some courses, 6 additional semesters lead to a Ph.D.) studies.

5. Is it mandatory for international students to have passed TOEFL or IELTS in order to enroll on a study program that is taught entirely in English?
Yes, as a general rule, you need TOEFL or IELTS in order to apply for a program that is entirely taught in English at a German university. If, however, you’re applying for a postgraduate program and already hold a Bachelors degree with English as the language of instruction, you do not need TOEFL or IELTS; it goes without saying: no need for TOEFL or IELTS if you’re a native speaker of English.

6. What are the “Fachhochschulen,” and in what way are they different from a University?
Let’s first mention what they have in common: they both lead to Bachelors and Masters degrees (or their equivalents in Germany). However, ‘Fachhochschulen’ do not award Ph.D. titles; in order to earn a Ph.D. a postgraduate course at a university has to be attended.

Universities of Applied Sciences (a.k.a. ‘Fachhochschulen’) are so conceived as to maximize the practical utilization of theoretical knowledge; they are suitable for candidates who have no intention of pursuing academic careers, but are rather interested in the acquisition of as much practical experience as possible. Hence, the vast majority of degree programs taught in them are in the fields of engineering and hard sciences; programs in business administration get taught at ‘Fachhochschulen’ too, but to a lesser extent, whereas courses in humanities and social sciences are rarely offered.

7. Is there free access to computer facilities and libraries at German universities?
As a general rule, all higher education institutions in Germany provide Internet access and set up email accounts for their students. In addition to that, they have libraries and archives that are very well stocked and that supply many of the titles that are mandatory reading for students so they don’t have to buy a lot of the reading material for their study courses.

8. Are there any age limits to apply for postgraduate study programs (Masters and Ph.D.) in Germany?
No, there are no limitations set on age.

9. Are there deadlines for direct enrollment?
The entrance application must be submitted by January 15 each year for the summer semester (beginning on April 1) and by July 15 for the winter semester (beginning on October 1). Students from outside Germany now have the opportunity to apply to several universities with only one set of documents through the Application Services for International Students (assist). assist will check that all necessary documents have been included and that they meet the necessary formal requirements, and will then forward them on to the respective universities.

10. Who does the assessment and recognition of foreign earned degrees in Germany?
As a general rule, the assessment of degrees and academic credits for admission purposes is the responsibility of universities. In assessing foreign higher education qualifications and degrees, the Central Office for Foreign Education (ZAB) of the Conference of German Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs (KMK) assists with provision of recommendations that are country-specific.

Pursuant to ‘The Assessment and Recognition of Foreign Professional Qualifications Act of 2012,’ the certification authorities of the federal state of residence (or the state in which he/she intends to reside) of the applicant are responsible for the recognition of foreign higher education and degrees earned for the purpose of enrolling on an advanced study program.

11. What tuition fees do higher education institutions charge in Germany?
Even in the last few years tuition fees were pretty much a non-issue in German higher education since they were ridiculously low compared to other developed countries. Also only two out of the 16 federal states (Bavaria and Lower Saxony) used to allow their higher education institutions to charge tuition fees – and when they did, they charged up to €500 per semester. As of October 2014, Germany decided to waive tuition fees in all of the provinces making higher education literally free of charge.

Postgraduate courses (Master’s and Ph.D.) however, are liable for some extra costs, varying between €650 and a few thousand Euros per semester; it is advised that prospective foreign postgraduate students do their due diligence.

12. Do I need a lot of money to finance my stay in Germany?
The fact that there are no tuition fees mustn’t lead you jump to the conclusion that studying in Germany will be cheap. Yes, there are creative and commonsensical ways to significantly reduce your overall cost of life there, but first and foremost you need to realistically assess the resources at your disposal – take good stock of yourself financially. Don’t delude yourself thinking that working part time while studying in Germany, will take care of all your financial worries, as that’s highly unlikely to be the case – your student visa and residence permit entitle you to 120 full (or 240 half) days of work only. A scholarship and/or support by a sponsor (parent, relative, etc) may be necessary, in which case the sponsor has to explicitly state their intention of supporting you.

For more information please read: The Cost of Living as an International Student in Germany!

13. What are good places, other than universities, to apply for a scholarship if I want to study in Germany?
A good place to start out is the German Research Foundation http://www.dfg.de/en/index.html 
Also, German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/12359-finding-scholarships/
Apart from offering scholarship programs they also give advice on almost everything related to studying in Germany.

You can find more information here!

14. Will I be allowed to work while studying in Germany?
A foreign (not a citizen of an EU or EEA member country – with the exception of Bulgaria and Romania which face restrictions until 2014) student studying full-time in Germany is legally allowed to work a maximum of 120 full (or 240 half) days within a year, without having to obtain a permission from German employment authorities.

The legally allowed number of working days (half days) for foreign students also includes voluntary work placements, regardless of whether the placement is paid or unpaid. Also, foreign students face an additional restriction: while working the legally allowed number of days (or half days), they cannot be self-employed or work on a freelance basis. You can find more information here!

15. Can my spouse/husband who will accompany me in Germany work too?
Spouses/Husbands accompanying foreign students may, under certain conditions, be permitted to work. If you are planning on having your husband or wife accompany you during your studies in Germany and hope they’ll be allowed to work, they must fully disclose their intention to work when applying for the visa.

16. Will I be liable to pay taxes in Germany?
It is the amount of money you’ve earned working as well as the duration of your stay in Germany, that determine whether you have to pay taxes or not. You are exempt from having to pay taxes if your stay in Germany doesn’t exceed six months and/or if you haven’t made more than €450 per month (considered to be income from a so-called ‘mini-job’ and therefore tax and pension contribution exempt) working in Germany.

If your annual gross income is less than €8,130 you will get all the taxes you paid refunded back to you at the end of the year when you file your tax return with tax authorities.

17. Do I have to open a German bank account?
It would be recommendable to open a German bank account because if you are going to rent a flat or if you are going to apply for an insurance you have to provide the bank details so that they would be able to debit the money because it is not possible to pay it cash. If you have a credit card of course you can also use it but cash cards are more common.

18. Can I bring my spouse and children to Germany while I am studying over there?
If you have a residence permit in Germany and if the duration of your stay is expected to be longer than one year, than family reunification is possible. However, in order for them to join you in Germany, you have to be able to support them without burdening social assistance in any way.

19. Do I need a student visa to study in Germany?
That depends on what your nationality is; citizens of EU or EEA member countries do not need a visa – only a valid ID card (once they settle and find a place to live in, they only have to register with the local authorities at the city they’ll be studying in – the ‘Einwohnermeldeamt’ – get the certificate confirming they have the right to reside in Germany, and they’re good to go).

Even if you’re a national of a country the passport-holders of which don’t need a visa to enter Germany and stay for up to 90 days, you have to exit the country after 90 days just as anyone who has entered on a Schengen visa has to, unless you are a citizen of a small number of countries (Andorra, Australia, Brazil, El Salvador, Honduras, Israel, Japan, Canada, Monaco, New Zealand, San Marino, South Korea and the United States of America) who can apply for a residence permit within three months of entry.

(For information pertaining to your nationality check http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/EinreiseUndAufenthalt/StaatenlisteVisumpflicht_node.html)

So, if you’re not a national of an EU or EEA member country (or of any of the above-mentioned countries the citizens of which can apply for a residence permit while still in Germany) than you need to be issued a national type visa before leaving for Germany if your intention is to stay there for longer than three months.

You apply for a student visa well in advance of planned departure for Germany at the German embassy or consulate general in your country.

20. What documents do I need when I apply for a student visa?
You have to inquire at the German embassy or consulate general in your country in order to be certain; usually the following documents need to be submitted:

proof of your previous studies (and a higher education entrance qualification recognized in Germany),
proof of admission from your university (or confirmation that you are soon to receive a letter of admission),
proof of your health insurance coverage,
proof of possessing sufficient financial resources (income or assets of roughly €8000 per year) and
proof of your language skills in German (or plans to attend a language course while in Germany).
21. If I have proof of admission from a German university providing full scholarship, is it necessary that I produce other financial proof in order to obtain the student visa?
As a general rule, a full scholarship is sufficient financial proof in order to apply for a visa; whether the embassy requires additional proof or not, depends on your country of nationality.

22. If my study program will be taught entirely in English, is it still necessary for me – in order to be issued a visa – to produce proof of sufficient German language skills?
No, if the exclusive language of instruction will be English you don’t need to know the German language; however, a little knowledge of German will take you a long way in your everyday life as a student.

23. Once I complete my studies at a German higher education institution and therefore the reason why I got issued the student visa ceases to exist, do I have to leave the country immediately?
Not necessarily, it’s possible to extend your student visa for one year, after completing your Bachelor’s degree.

24. How can I get the residence permit?
Persons who are coming to Germany with a visa and who intend to stay for a longer period in Germany have to have a residence permit. The responsible authority therefore is the foreign office. For the residence permit you need a certificate of the enrollment from the university, the registration from the authorities, a proof of financing and a valid health insurance contract. A residence permit for the purpose of studying is issued for a period of two years and have to be extended before the two years run out. When you are going to extend your visa you always have to show them a valid insurance contract.

25. What is the typical path to a Ph.D. in Germany in a nutshell?
Assuming the degree currently held qualifies him/her for a doctoral program in Germany, the typical path a candidate would have to follow to a doctorate, in a nutshell, would be as follows: once the area of study is selected, the candidate needs to find an academic supervisor/mentor a.k.a. the “Doktorvater” or “Doktormutter” in German, who will guide the doctoral candidate through the research phase leading to the writing of his/her dissertation.

There are different ways of going about finding an academic supervisor in Germany: either through personal contacts your professors may have in Germany or through online research of various scientific publications, e.g. http://www.hochschulkompass.de/en/

Once an academic supervisor is found, the doctoral candidate has to enroll at a university program for several semesters, where he/she will be gaining scientific experience and working as an assistant, all the while researching and writing the dissertation.

Another increasingly popular (especially among foreign students) way to earn a Ph.D. in Germany is through one of the so-called ‘structured doctoral programs,’ wherein a team of professors supervises a group of doctoral candidates.

26. Which qualification do I need to present to be admitted for Ph.D. Programmes?
If you wish to gain a Ph.D. in Germany, then you definitely need to hold a university degree which is equivalent to a degree gained at a German university. Equivalency is decided by the university in question and you should contact your chosen institution directly.

You can find more information at http://www.hochschulkompass.de/en/doctoral-studies.html

27. How can I gain a doctorate in Germany?
As soon as you have chosen a topic area, you need to find a professor, who will act as your academic supervisor. Once you have an academic supervisor for your doctoral thesis, you will be required to enroll at the relevant university for a number of semesters and attend certain courses. Please inquire as soon as possible, whether the degree you currently hold is qualified for a doctoral program.

German universities are increasingly creating special programs for foreign doctoral candidates which have been specifically designed to meet the needs and interests of international applicants. These special measures primarily involve preparation, guidance-counselling and the provision of favorable research conditions. Not only can the thesis often be written in English or another world language, but study-integrated German language courses also help students overcome the language barrier. Such program includes:

PhD support programs,
Binational doctoral arrangement,
Graduate Schools.
Information on these programs as well as the addresses of all HEI and all doctoral programs and doctorates can be found on the following website: www.higher-education-compass.de

28. What are the admission/enrollment criteria at German universities and other higher education institutions?
In Germany, a prerequisite (and also the traditional route) to enrollment into a tertiary level education institution (university, university of applied sciences a.k.a. ‘Fachhoschule,’ college of art and music, etc) is a passing score on the final examination whereby a certificate called the ‘Abitur’ (or Fachabitur) is obtained. As a general rule, Abitur – formally enabling students to attend a university – is necessary for enrollment into most universities, but exceptions to this rule are not infrequent (one of the alternative routes is a passing score on the ‘Begabtenprüfung’ a.k.a. ‘the aptitude test’).

As an international student, however, you need to apply well in advance in order for the International Students Office (Akademisches Auslandsamt) to consider your application – including previous academic record – and determine whether it meets all admission requirements; for this purpose you will need to produce proof of completion of secondary education (e.g. high school diploma, ‘Matura,’ ‘A-Levels,’ or if required in your country, proof of having passed a university entrance examination) that is an equivalent of Abitur.

As to whether your high school diploma gets accepted for purposes of studying in Germany, depends on what country it was issued in; if your high school diploma was issued in a EU or EEA member country, then it is accepted for direct application at a university, otherwise you may have to undergo (again depending on the country of issuance of your high school diploma) a ‘Feststellungsprüfung’ assessment examination, after having attended a Studienkolleg (preparatory course). For further details go to: https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/voraussetzungen/en/6017-university-admission-and-requirements/?id=1&ebene=1

Certain universities of applied sciences a.k.a. ‘Fachhoschulen,’ may require that you complete a working internship prior to enrolling.

In order to be admitted to a post-graduate (Master’s or Ph.D.) program, a formal recognition of your university degree is required, from your home country or another country.

29. Do all of my documents, enclosed in the application I’m sending in, have to be originals/certified or can they be copies instead?
As a general rule, you only send certified documents; certain additional documents, however, such as proof of internship, etc. are exempt from that rule.

30. What level of knowledge of the German language do I need in order to attend a ‘Studienkolleg’?
Your German language skills need to be at the B1 level (proof thereof is required), which is considered an equivalent of roughly 600 hours.

31. Will my school-leaving qualification be recognised?
In order to be allowed to study in Germany, you need a ‘Hochschulzugangsberechtigung’ (university entrance entitlement): this simply means a school-leaving qualification that entitles you to study at university. In Germany, this is the ‘Allgemeine Hochschulreife’ (Abitur) or ‘Fachhochschulreife’. So how do you find out if your qualification is also recognised? On the Anabin website (only in German) you can select both your homeland and the qualification you have obtained. When you have entered this information, you will receive a detailed explanation of whether or not your qualification is adequate for direct university entrance.

32. What exactly do I need for the enrollment at a university?
You have to show them a valid insurance in Germany (Mawista Student and Mawista Science are accepted by all universities),
You have to show them the notification of admission,
You have to have a receipt of the payment to the student organization,
You have to give them a passport picture,
You have to show them your passport with the valid visa.
33. What exactly is a Studentenwerk?
Studentenwerk is an organisation which acts in the interest of the students of each particular region in Germany. Each German region has its own studentwnwerk, but they cooperate closely on the national level. Studentenwerke generally organize and run cafeterias, restaurants, housing units, the BAföG for the government, and even psychological and low level health services.

Some regions and universities mandate a certain yearly fee by each student for the studentenwerk, making it legally a very close cooperation between the semi-independent organisation and the local governments.

34. Can I do a “Dual Studium” as a foreigner?
Most universities in Germany offer the so called “Duales Studium”. This special way of studying makes it possible for students to study theory at a traditional university and at the same time practice what they have learned at companies who partner with the university or program.

Depending on you visa you will most likely be able as a foreigner to work only 120 days out of the year. As long as this is in agreement with your university’s program you can participate in the highly successful Dual Studium program.

35. Will my driver’s license be valid in Germany
As a general rule, the validity of foreign driver’s licenses is limited to six months. If, as a full-time student you claim residence in Germany, and after six months your driver’s license expires, the only way for you to continue to drive legally would be to transfer your license. Whether the transferring of your license requires you to undergo the theoretical and driving tests administered by driving schools, depends on the country of issuance of your driver’s license (find out what regulations apply to your home country by contacting the local dept. of motor vehicles/driver’s licenses).

For the purpose of transferring your driver’s license in Germany you will need to produce the following:

Your original driver’s license (has to still be valid),
Passport-size photograph of you,
Proof of residency in Germany and
Your passport or ID card.
36. Which are the best universities for my field of study?
Each year, the Center for Higher Education Development (CHE) publishes Germany’s most comprehensive ranking of higher education institutions. This multidimensional ranking uses up to 40 different indicators to provide a differentiated and detailed view of the strengths and weaknesses of German higher education by subject areas. This is complemented by a research ranking published every fall to provide specific information on the research contribution of German higher education institutions. On the CHE website you can find out what the top-ranked German universities are in every subject area.

37. What are the requirements for getting a PhD in Germany?
The most important formal requirement is a very good university degree that is recognised in Germany. Generally, your degree must be equivalent to a master’s degree, awarded after at least eight semesters of university study. There is one exception: Especially qualified international applicants who hold a bachelor’s degree may be admitted to a doctoral programme in what is called a “fast track programme”. In such cases, applicants are usually required to pass an examination.

Each German university is responsible for admitting candidates to its PhD programmes and recognising prior academic achievement. This is why candidates must apply directly to the Dean’s Office or the faculty’s doctoral committee to have their past degrees recognised. In certain cases, admission to a PhD programme is determined by an additional examination which assesses whether the candidate’s knowledge is equivalent to that of a holder of a degree from Germany.

You can obtain more information from the professors who are responsible for the subject in question. It may also be helpful – and in some cases, necessary – to include letters of recommendation from your university professors at home. Source: DAAD!

38. Do I have to open a German bank account?
It would be recommendable to open a German bank account because if you are going to rent a flat or if you are going to apply for an insurance you have to provide the bank details so that they would be able to debit the money because it is not possible to pay it cash. If you have a credit card of course you can also use it but cash cards are more common.

39. What kind of insurance do I need to matriculate at a university?
In Germany there are two kinds of health insurance, the public insurance and the private one. Without an insurance it is not possible for you to matriculate at a university. Up to the age of 30 years or until your 14th term of study you normally have to be insured over a public insurance company. But you also have the possibility to exempt yourself from the public insurance company if you would like to be insured over a private insurance. For getting this exemption you will have to go directly to the public insurance company before you are going to matriculate yourself at the university. But please note, if you exempt yourself from the public insurance company you can´t be insured over them as long as you are a student. The product Mawista Student is a perfect choice for foreign students in Germany!

40. How can I find a flat in Germany?
If you would like to register for a room or an apartment in the student accommodation you should contact your local Studentenwerk directly. On their website you can also find the offers of accommodation, information on the prices and also for the furnishing. The offers are varied and range from simple rooms to flats for couples, for students with children and also for students with disabilities. The furnished rooms are mostly equipped with a writing desk, a bed, a wardrobe and shelving. But pillows, blankets, bedding and towels are not provided. But this can be bought or rented as well. If possible do not arrive at the weekend or late at night, in case there is no other choice you have to inform the Studentenwerk so that you can discuss with them where you can get the keys from. If you still don´t have a flat after your arrival in Germany, please go as soon as possible to the Studentwerk they often have an emergency accommodation available at the beginning of term.

41. How can I get the residence permit?
Persons who are coming to Germany with a visa and who intend to stay for a longer period in Germany have to have a residence permit. The responsible authority therefore is the foreign office. For the residence permit you need a certificate of the enrollment from the university, the registration from the authorities, a proof of financing and a valid health insurance contract. A residence permit for the purpose of studying is issued for a period of two years and have to be extended before the two years run out. When you are going to extend your visa you always have to show them a valid insurance contract.

42. Can I bring my spouse and children to Germany while I am studying over there?
If you have a residence permit in Germany and if the duration of your stay is expected to be longer than one year, than family reunification is possible. However, in order for them to join you in Germany, you have to be able to support them without burdening social assistance in any way.

43. Will my driver’s license be valid in Germany
As a general rule, the validity of foreign driver’s licenses is limited to six months. If, as a full-time student you claim residence in Germany, and after six months your driver’s license expires, the only way for you to continue to drive legally would be to transfer your license. Whether the transferring of your license requires you to undergo the theoretical and driving tests administered by driving schools, depends on the country of issuance of your driver’s license (find out what regulations apply to your home country by contacting the local dept. of motor vehicles/driver’s licenses).

For the purpose of transferring your driver’s license in Germany you will need to produce the following:

Your original driver’s license (has to still be valid),
Passport-size photograph of you,
Proof of residency in Germany and
Your passport or ID card.
44. Will I be allowed to bring my pet to Germany?
If you absolutely have to, you can bring your pet to Germany, as long as you can prove that the animal has been duly vaccinated against rabies (30 days at least prior to crossing the border to enter Germany, but not date back more than 1 year for dogs and six months for cats).

You also have to reckon with a tax being levied for dogs, to be paid after you’ve registered the animal with local authorities.

45. Is it easy to travel around the country in Germany – how mobile can I expect to be?
It is fairly easy; although you don’t need a car to get around in Germany – owing to its outstanding public transportation network – driving on German autobahns is sheer pleasure. On the other hand, the ICE high-speed trains, Deutsche Bahn AG, the suburban S-Bahn network, tram and subway lines cover together the entire territory of Germany.

Domestic flights between all major cities are also available and are increasingly being used. Buss and taxi services are also readily available. For those who enjoy cycling, special cycling lanes and suitable places for parking are widespread.Study in Germany - Land of Ideas

Frequently Asked Questions About Studying in Germany
 
If you’re interested in joining the international student community in Germany but don’t know where to begin, we have compiled a list of frequently asked questions about studying in Germany we think might help you get started.

This Western European country has gained quite a lot of popularity among international students in the past years. Specifically, the international student numbers have nearly reached 400,000 according to the latest statistics, making Germany the perfect study destination to optimal conditions for international students aiming to pursue their university qualification.

Here are the most frequently asked questions about studying in Germany:

1. Why Should I Choose Germany to Pursue My Degree?

Germany is home to some of the best universities in the world and students love this country due to its affordability, cultural diversity, as well as employability. Some of the universities in Germany are ranked among the top worldwide universities in the major ranking lists ensuring that the education system in the country is top-notch. You will graduate with just the right skills to enter the global labour market with confidence.

You will be able to find any course of your interest in German universities since there is a wide range of options available. You will get to grow academically as well as develop your personal skills. Apart from the academic benefits, you will also get to know what an authentic German experience is like by visiting museums and old castles, attending festivals, climbing a mountain or swimming in a lake. Being an international student in Germany has just so much to offer.

2. Are There English-Taught Degree Courses in Germany?

There are numerous International Degree Courses taught in English for international students who do not have sufficient knowledge of the German language to enrol in a course entirely in German. You may find programmes in English if you go through the International Study Programmes in Germany and search for options in English.

3. Do I Need to Pass TOEFL or IELTS for an English-Taught Course?

If you are a native speaker of English, you will not be required to provide either one. However, you will need TOEFL or IELTS in order to apply for a programme that is entirely in English at a German university. Additionally, if you are applying for a postgraduate degree programme and already have an undergraduate degree in an English-taught course, then you will not be needing TOEFL or IELTS.

4. Do Higher Education Institutions in Germany Charge Tuition Fees?

Tuition fees at all public universities were officially removed in the year 2014, however, they were reintroduced in the year 2017 in the state of Baden-Württemberg for non-EU/EEA students. These fees are set at €1,500 per semester and students pursuing a second degree will be required to pay €650 per semester. Students coming from Erasmus member states are exempt from these fees.

Additionally, in the other states of Germany tuition fees for non-EU/EEA member states have not been reintroduced yet, which means undergraduate-level tuition at all other public universities remains free of charge. Note, however, that students will still be required to pay a small administration fee per semester which usually does not exceed €250.

On another note, in comparison to other popular study destinations, tuition fees are relatively low in Germany.

5. How Much Money Will I Need to Study in Germany?

Compared to other European countries, the cost of living in Germany is quite affordable. It has been estimated that in order to cover your living expenses as an international student in Germany, you will need approximately €992 (around $1,085 US dollars) per month, which accumulates to €11,904 per year (around $13,028 US dollars).

One of the largest expenses you will face while being an international student in Germany is your monthly rent, taking into consideration that the prices for other basic needs such as food, clothes, and entertainment are in accordance with the EU average.

6. Do I Need a Student Visa to Study in Germany?

Citizens coming from member countries of the EU/EEA do not need a visa to study in Germany, however, they do have to register with the local authorities at the city they will be studying, once they arrive, to obtain a certificate that proves they are allowed to reside in Germany for the duration of their studies.

If you are not a national of EU/EEA member countries, then you will need to apply for a student visa in order to enter Germany and pursue your degree. For studies lasting more than 3 months, you will need a national visa. Make sure to apply as early as possible so you avoid any potential processing delays.

7. How Do I Apply for a Student Visa to Germany?

You are supposed to apply for the German student visa at the German Embassy/Consulate in your home country. You will be required to set up an appointment at the Embassy, gather all the required documents for a German student visa, attend the interview on the appointed date, and wait for the decision.

Make sure to prepare for the interview accordingly and be on time. You might want to check out these commonly asked German visa interview questions and tips.

8. Will I Be Allowed to Work as an International Student in Germany?

Yes, you will be allowed to work part-time while being a full-time international student in Germany. However, the working days are limited to 120 full work days or 240 half days of work only. This limited number of working days also applies to voluntary work placements, either paid or unpaid. Additionally, while working the legally allowed number of days, foreign students cannot be self-employed for work as freelancers.

On the other hand, if you are a full-time student from member states of the EU/EEA, you are allowed to work up to 20 hours per week.

9. Do I Need to Open a German Bank Account?

Opening a German bank account while you are a student in Germany would be advisable since you will be needing it when it comes to renting a flat or applying for insurance. There are payments you can’t make in cash, therefore you will need to debit the money.

If you are an international student coming from non-EU/EEA countries, you must prove you have enough financial resources to cover your expenses in Germany. To do so, you can open a German Blocked Account, which is the most commonly used account for international students in Germany. The annual amount for the blocked account is €11,904, as of 2024, and students can withdraw a maximum of €992 per month. Learn how to open a German Blocked Account for international students.

10. Do I Need to Know German If My Study Programme Is in English?

If the instruction language of your study programme is entirely English, then you will not need to possess proficient German language skills.

11. Can I Stay in Germany After I Finish My Studies?

The law allows international students to stay in Germany and look for a job for 18 months after they have graduated. However, initially, you must apply to extend your residence permit. During these 18 months, you can work as much as you want in any kind of employment in order to support yourself. If you succeed in finding a job in your professional field and are granted a legal contract, then you are eligible to apply for an EU Blue Card.

12. Do I Need Health Insurance to Study in Germany?

Yes, you do need health insurance in order to study in Germany. Moreover, foreign students are entitled to public (statutory) health insurance, which means degree students up to the age of 30 are eligible to register with a public health insurance provider instead of a private one.

Additionally, if you need a visa to enter Germany, you will be required to provide proof of health insurance as part of the visa requirements. In this instance, you will have to obtain private travel health insurance until you are properly matriculated in your university and eligible to take up public health insurance.

Learn all about health insurance for international students in Germany.

13. What Admission Criteria Do German Universities Have?

One of the main criteria to apply for admission at a German university is proof of a recognized university entrance qualification, which means you need to provide proof you have passed a university entrance exam that is equivalent to Abitur.

Basically, Abitur is a certificate obtained after passing a final examination offered by university-preparatory schools in Germany, and it formally enables students to attend university. So, if your high school diploma was issued by member countries of EU/EEA, then it will be accepted by German universities. Additionally, if your diploma was issued by other countries, you might have to undergo a ‘Feststellungsprüfung’ examination after attending a preparatory course known as ‘Studienkolleg’.

For more information, check this German university admission criteria guide.

14. Where Can I Find Accommodation in Germany?

As a foreign student in Germany, you may opt for numerous accommodation options, such as German halls of residence, private apartments, as well as shared flats. Student halls are one of the most affordable forms of accommodation while offering great living conditions with plenty of socializing opportunities. Sharing rent is also quite common among international students while getting a private apartment is one of the less affordable accommodation choices.

15. Can I Bring My Family While I Am Studying in Germany?

Yes, you can bring your family, such as your spouse of children, with you if you have a residence permit in Germany. If your stay in Germany is longer than one year, you have the possibility of applying for a family reunion visa. However, you must also provide proof that you have enough financial resources to support them without the need of social assistance.

Learn more about bringing your family to Germany while studying.

16. How Can I Travel Around Germany If I Don’t Have a Car?

Travelling around Germany is pretty simple even if you do not own a car. This is due to its very comprehensive and efficient public transport.

Public transport in Germany includes the subway/underground (U-Bahn), suburban commuter rail (S-Bahn), trams, as well as buses.

17. What Is ‘Studienkolleg’?

Studienkolleg is a one-year preparatory course for students whose school-leaving diploma is not recognized by German universities. During this course, students learn subjects of a particular degree programme as well as the German language, for five days a week, aiming to get a passing score of the final assessment examination. After they pass the final examination, they are eligible and qualified to apply for a degree programme at a German university. In order to attend a ‘Studienkolleg’, your German language skills need to be at the B1 level.

Studienkolleg is explained in detail here.

18. What Is ‘Fachhochschulen’?

Universities of Applied Sciences also known as ‘Fachhochschulen’ are designed to maximize the practical experience. They are perfect for those who are interested in gaining as much practical experience as possible. In addition, most of its degree programmes are in the fields of engineering and hard sciences. However, just like other universities, they also offer Bachelor and Master’s degrees excluding PhD titles.

19. What Is ‘Studentenwerk’?

Applying for a postgraduate programme in Germany follows more or less the same process as applying for an undergraduate programme.

Question about German University

Education
Hello, I am a student from Vietnam, and I know that to be eligible for restricted subjects courses in Germany, I need to complete two years of study in my home country. However, I am uncertain if I can pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science if I have previously studied Electronics and Communications Engineering in my home country. I appreciate any help you can provide.

(I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I can not find any other place related to this)

That place would be r/Germany, which has a wiki specifically about studying as well. Germans tend to not know a lot about immigration related things

Sometimes r/germany can't even answer some of these questions because each uni/hochschule has their own requirements. As I foreigner who also lurks in this sub, I have seen so many of these academic related questions about uni requirements got told to directly contact the uni/hs themselves.

We don‘t know that because we don‘t need to do it. If you want to be sure ask in r/Germany or the german foreign academic service. That being said: unless any 2 years of study are enough to meet the criteria I doubt that electronics would be close enough to CSCI. But again: we can‘t really help you with that.

Write an e-mail to larger universities in Germany like FU Berlin or TU Munich. They all have admission offices for international students. 

I know that in Berlin they have a special agency/office/department which handles international admissions with people working to verify documents for the universities

The student registry office of the uni you want to go to will be able to help with this. If you don't know which one you want to go to yet, write emails to a few, it might differ between states.

The german term for that office is Studierendensekretariat, just in case a uni uses a different translation than the one I found.

1. Can I study in Germany free of charge?

This will depend on your study level, country of origin, and which state you study in. Tuition fees at all public universities were originally axed in 2014, but were reintroduced for non-EU/EEA students in the south-western state of Baden-Württemberg in autumn 2017.

These fees are set at €1,500 per semester – therefore coming to €3,000 per year (~US$3,440). Students obtaining a second degree will pay a reduced rate of €650 per semester, or €1,300 per year (~US$1,500). Students from Erasmus member states are exempt from these fees. Although no longer free, tuition fees are still far lower than other popular study destinations.

It’s possible that non-EU/EEA tuition fees will be reintroduced to other states in the coming years, but, for now, undergraduate-level tuition at all other public universities in Germany remains free of charge for all students, both in and outside the EU. You will, however, need to pay a nominal administration fee per semester, which is typically no more than €250 (~US$225).

For postgraduate students, however, tuition fees still exist.  These fees may be avoided (or cut dramatically) if you have already graduated from an undergraduate program in Germany in the last few years. If you studied in another country at undergraduate level, you are classed as a non-consecutive student and will need to pay tuition fees, which will vary between universities and courses.

For more information about tuition fees in Germany, see the following:

How Much Does it Cost to Study in Germany?
Tuition Fees Reintroduced at Some German Universities
2. What qualifications do universities in Germany offer?

Under the Bologna reform, all universities in Germany offer internationally recognized degrees. A BA or a BSc (Bachelor of Arts / Bachelor of Science) will usually take six semesters (three years) to complete, and these are the most common undergraduate degrees. For postgraduate studies, an MA or MSc (Master of Arts / Master of Science) will take two-four semesters (one-two years) and a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) will last four-six semesters (two-three years).

More specialized degrees are also available at certain German universities. If you’d like more information about gaining an MBA (Masters in Business Administration) in Germany, visit this guide on our sister site TopMBA.com.

3. How can I study medicine in Germany?

You can study medicine for free at any public university in Germany, but will need to have a strong knowledge of both German and English, among other requirements. Medical training programs in Germany are not split into bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and will take at least six years and three months to complete. Spaces are very competitive, with many more applicants than places. You can read more about the requirements, application process, program structure and more in our article How to Study Medicine in Germany. 

4. What are the entry requirements to study in Germany?

To study abroad in Germany you need to hold a higher education entrance qualification or Hochschulzugangsberechtigung (HZB). This qualification can come in many formats, particularly for international students who have gained their school-leaving qualifications in a different country.

For prospective undergraduate students, a high-school diploma, school-leaving certificate or university entrance exam result is usually sufficient. For postgraduate programs, students need to provide an undergraduate degree certificate. Usually, if your qualification would allow you entry into higher education in your home country, it will also be sufficient to allow you to apply to German universities. To check whether your current qualifications are recognized for study in Germany, use the form on this page.

If you find that your qualification is not recognized, you are also able to take a preparatory course at a Studienkolleg before taking a compulsory assessment test known as a Feststellungprüfung. This assessment will cover areas that are relevant to the program you wish to study and will prepare you for university.

If you wish to undertake a program being taught in German (the teaching language of most undergraduate programs in Germany), you will also need to prove your German proficiency (see question five below for more information).

In addition to German-language proficiency and an entrance qualification, you may also need to meet the specific entry requirements of your chosen university program. These requirements depend on the reputation of the school and of the program, and can be found by looking at the program information in the university’s prospectus or online.

5. Do I need to speak German?

The language of instruction at most universities in Germany is German. All students undertaking a German-taught program will need to be able to demonstrate a firm knowledge of the language, either by means of a language test result or by taking a preparatory course. Accepted proficiency tests are the DSH (German Language University Entrance Examination for International Applicants), TestDaF (Test of German as a Foreign Language), GDS (Goethe Institut German Language Diploma) and the DSD (German Language Diploma of the Standing Conference of the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs, Level II). If you are only studying in Germany for one or two semesters you may not need to provide this evidence.

If you have a limited knowledge of German, you could consider taking an English-language program. There are a growing number of English-taught programs at universities in Germany, particularly at postgraduate level. If you are a non-native English speaker, you may be required to provide proof of your English-language proficiency with a TOEFL or IELTS result. If your chosen school requires this, they will list proof of English-language proficiency as an entry requirement.

However, even if you do study in Germany in English, it’s advisable to learn the basics of the German language to enable you to communicate more effectively with the local residents.


6. How do I apply to universities in Germany?

Admissions processes vary between institutions, so make sure you check the information given by your chosen university before applying. If you’re unable to find the entry requirements of a program you want to apply for, or you aren’t sure how to apply, visit the university’s International Office (Akademisches Auslandsamt) and either read the information provided online or contact the office directly. There should be staff members available to provide support and advice on any topic relating to international student applications.

Generally, you’ll be asked to provide the following documentation with your application:

A certified copy of your higher education entrance qualification (e.g. a high-school diploma) and any other relevant qualifications in the original language
A translated overview of the subjects and grades of your qualifications
A passport photo
A copy of your passport (personal information and photo ID)
Proof of language proficiency (a test certificate or online equivalent)
For most public German universities, the application period for the winter semester begins in early May and ends mid-July. For the summer intake, the application period is between early December and mid-January. You should expect to receive a formal acceptance or rejection approximately one to two months after the deadline has passed.

To ensure the best chances of acceptance, take care to provide all the documentation asked for, make sure all your documentation is certified (copies of documents also need to be certified by the awarding school) and check that you’ve filled out all your information correctly before submitting your application.

For more information on how to apply, see this article.

7. Do I need a German student visa to study in Germany?

Whether you need a German student visa depends on your country of origin. If you are from a country within the EU or the EEA or from Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you do not need a student visa. If you are from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Japan or South Korea you still do not require a student visa, but you will need to register for a residence permit upon arrival in Germany. If you are from Andorra, Brazil, El Salvador, Honduras, Monaco, San Marino or Taiwan, you only need a visa if you plan on working in Germany before or after your studies. If your home country hasn’t been mentioned above, then you will need to apply for a German student visa at least three months before you are due to travel.

For detailed information on how to apply for a German student visa or a residence permit, check out this article:

How to Get a German Student Visa
8. Where can I study in Germany?

A total of 45 German universities currently feature in the QS World University Rankings®, meaning that you have a great selection of world-leading universities to choose from. If you want to study in a world-renowned student city, you might consider Munich or Berlin, both ranked among the world’s top 10 cities for students in the QS Best Student Cities index.

However, there are lots of regions of Germany with something to offer, including North Rhine-Westphalia (home of cities such as Dusseldorf and Cologne), Baden-Wurttemberg (home of Stuttgart), Bavaria (home of Munich), Hesse (home of Frankfurt am Main), Lower Saxony (home of Hannover), Saxony (home of Dresden) and Hamburg (a state which is also a city).

To help you choose a university, the QS World University Rankings by Subject has rankings for 48 subjects as of 2018 – simply narrow the results down by country to select only German institutions. You can also use the compare tool to further narrow down your choices on factors such as international diversity and rankings history.

9. What’s the difference between a university and a fachhochschulen?

While all degree programs in Germany lead to a recognized bachelor’s or master’s qualification (or the German equivalent), there are some institutions, named fachhochschulen, which are more geared towards practical learning. Fachhochschulen or universities of applied sciences, typically offer degrees in fields such as engineering, natural science and business administration. Attending a university of applied science may give you a closer relationship with industry contacts and offer more opportunity for practical learning, including internships. If you wish to pursue an academic career, on the other hand, fachhochschulen may not be the best option, as there is less focus on theoretical work and they do not award PhDs.

10. Are scholarships available to cover living costs?

Although tuition fees in Germany are non-existent at public universities, you still need to consider how you’ll cover living costs. If you don’t have a sponsor or supporting family member, there are countless opportunities to gain scholarships to cover these costs.

Scholarships to study in Germany can be obtained in several ways. The German government offers some funding to international students through the DAAD or the European Commission’s Erasmus+ scheme, but many opportunities are offered independently by German universities or external funding bodies. Browse the funding options on your chosen university’s website to see if they offer any international scholarships –these are often awarded based on merit, subject of study and/or country of origin.

For a selection of general and subject-specific scholarships to study in Germany, see this list:

12. Where will I live during my studies?

Unfortunately, most German universities do not offer accommodation to enrolling students. This means that finding accommodation is up to you. With little to no tuition fees in Germany, rent is likely to be your biggest monthly expense, and this will vary depending on which part of the country you live in. In big cities within Western Germany (i.e. Dusseldorf, Cologne etc.) and smaller, student-oriented cities such as Heidelberg and Freiburg, you should expect to pay slightly more than if you were living in eastern Germany (i.e. Berlin).

When looking for accommodation in Germany, you should consider student residences, shared accommodation or an apartment. An unshared apartment is the most expensive choice, and this will generally cost in the region of €357 (~US$320) a month. Shared accommodation would be cheaper at around €280 (~US$250) a month, while student residences are cheaper yet again at around €234 (~US$210) a month.

If you struggle with finding accommodation, you can also look for somewhere temporary to cover your first few days or weeks in the country. In these instances, emergency housing may be provided by the university or you could try couch-surfing, staying in a hostel, B&B or hotel.

For more information on finding accommodation visit this article on the DAAD website. You could also use the Study-in-de’s accommodation finder, which includes information, addresses and application details on a large selection of student residence halls in Germany.

13. Can I work in Germany during my studies?

Yes, you can. If you are a full-time EU or EEA student (or from Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Switzerland) you can work for up to 20 hours per week. If you are a full-time student from outside of the EU, you will be limited to working up to 120 full days or 240 half days per year before you must apply for a work permit. Upon gaining paid work in Germany you should contact the German employment office to learn about the legal conditions.

14. Can I stay in Germany when I complete my studies?

Yes. After completing your studies in Germany as an international student, you’re able to apply for a residence permit to stay in the country and seek work for an additional period of 18 months. If you gain work in Germany within this time you should make sure that you extend your visa, residence or work permit to ensure you are living in the country legally. Find out more here.

Tip: Find out more about eligibility for part-time jobs while studying in Germany before answering.

Have You Researched Your Career Prospects?

Answer: Talk about how your goal is to return home to start a career related to your studies rather than staying in Germany for work or permanent residency. Assure them that you’ve done your research and know there’s a demand for your chosen career back home.

Tips for Attending a Student Visa Interview

Your appearance and behavior should reflect the best aspects of yourself. It is important to be well-dressed, punctual, and use appropriate arguments during the interview.

When to Go to the German Embassy?

Arrive at the German Embassy a few minutes early for your interview to prepare. It’s important to be punctual but not too early or late. Greet all staff members politely.

To reduce stress and avoid being late due to parking or traffic issues, avoid driving on the interview day. Instead, arrange for someone to drive you or take a taxi well in advance. 

What to Wear?

Put careful thought into your clothing for the interview. Choose comfortable yet professional outfits such as a dress or shirt and pants that show a confident appearance. 

Avoid overdoing it with strong fragrances or revealing clothing, and excessive accessories, especially those with controversial meanings. 

What to Take With You?

Ensure you have all the required documents for your German student visa application with you on the day of your interview. The visa staff will expect you to have both the original documents and copies, all organized according to the required standards.

It’s important to be well-prepared and not rely on visa officials to photocopy your documents or wait for you to retrieve forgotten documents later. Check and double-check that you have included all the necessary documents in the correct order well in advance of your interview day.

How to Answer?

During the student visa interview, answer questions honestly without false information or avoiding questions. Visa officers ask about many aspects of your application to verify the authenticity of your intentions. Remain transparent throughout the interview.

What to Say?

Ensure that all the information you say to the visa officers matches the documents you submit and your current or past situations. 

What Not to Say?

Being honest during an interview doesn’t mean providing excessive detail or going off-topic. It’s important to be specific and focus on directly answering the question asked without providing unnecessary information.

My Decision to Study in Germany

I remember the first time I made up my mind to study in Germany. There were a lot of questions running through my mind. Unluckily for me, I had no one to answer these questions and had to find out the answers myself. Most of the answers came to me through thorough research. Others, I had to learn through bitter experiences, which cost me valuable time and money. I was surprised at how much false information was on the web when I finally went through the entire process and made it to Germany as a student. So, I decided to take it upon myself to provide correct and detailed information so students can make a smooth transition from their home countries to Germany.

Who better to answer a question about studying in Germany than someone who started from scratch and was able to make it to Germany as a student? I believe I have a better insight into the minds of prospective students. I understand what sort of answers they seek when they want to study in Germany since I was once in their shoes. I hope these answers will save students some time that they could have used researching and also prevent them from repeating the same mistakes that I did.

Is there an age limit for bachelor degree in Germany? Learn the answer and much more below!
Is there an age limit for bachelor degree in Germany? Learn the answer and much more below!
1. Is Studying in Germany Worth It When Compared to Other Countries Like the US and UK?

Germany, the UK, and the USA are all equally developed nations that provide great infrastructure and opportunities to international students. Obviously, countries like the USA, Canada, and the UK are English-speaking, while Germany is not. It all boils down to if you are prepared to learn a new language.

Even though most Germans understand English, they will prefer that you speak German. You will need to attain a certain level of German if you plan to live and work in Germany. If you are not prepared to sacrifice to learn a difficult language like German, then Germany is probably not for you.

2. Is Education Free in Germany?

Yes. Germany is among the few countries worldwide that do not charge domestic and international students tuition fees. Students are only required to pay semester fees and contributions, which rarely exceed 400 euros.

Unfortunately, the state of Baden-Württemberg started charging tuition fees of around 1500 euros to non-EU students in the autumn of 2017. Other German States like North-Rhine Westphalia are also considering introducing tuition. Prospective international students should take advantage of this tuition-free period because you never know when it might end.

3. What Are Semester Fees and Contributions?

Even though most German universities do not charge tuition fees, students are subject to a student body and social contribution fee, which rarely exceeds 400 euros. The social contribution is used to finance the semester ticket, a public transportation pass valid for most bus and train lines running in the State where you will be studying. The Semester Ticket provides a range of mobility options to students at an otherwise unbeatable price.

4. Does Germany Offer English-Taught Programmes?

Most people assume because English is not the official language in Germany, degree programmes in Germany must all automatically be in German. However, this is not the case. Over 800 master’s and bachelor’s programmes in Germany are taught completely in English. You can find most of these programmes by visiting the DAAD website.

5. Are There Bachelor’s Programmes Taught Completely in English in Germany or Is It Only Master's?

Yes. Germany has over 100 bachelor’s programmes in English in various fields. To qualify to study at the undergraduate level, you need the Abitur. The Abitur, in most cases, is not equivalent to the high school diploma from most countries. It is usually the equivalent of a high school diploma plus one or two years of study at an accredited university.

Be sure to inquire from the university you wish to apply to whether the high school certificate from your country is equal to the Abitur. You can also visit anabin, which contains information on foreign institutions and academic qualifications. Please note that this site is available only in German.

6. How Difficult Is It to Get Admission to a German University?

Admission to German universities is getting more competitive every year. With the decision of Finland and Sweden to introduce tuition fees to international students, that means Germany is one of the few countries left that still offer tuition-free privileges to international students. German universities, as such, receive numerous applications from students from all over the globe who want to gain access to this tuition-free education.

Universities are getting stricter and stricter every year with their selection process, as only a few seats are available. However, if you have excellent grades, then you have nothing to worry about. Most German universities base a huge part of their admission decision on the grades you received from your previous studies.

7. How Reputable Are German Universities?

Some people feel it’s not worth studying in Germany because their universities are not as highly ranked as those in the US and UK. However, you can look at it in this light: In the US and UK, there are around 20 universities (most are private and very expensive) that are household names. They have a few thousand others that offer a good education but aren’t household names like MIT, Harvard, and Cambridge. You can also find universities where you can just hang out and party for four years and get a certificate, as well as places that try to rip you off or are run by religious zealots and still maintain accreditation.

German Student Visa Interview Questions and Answers
In Germany, if you go to a public university, you’ll receive a quality, rigorous, and affordable education, no matter what the national or international rankings may say. Most public universities are funded by the state and thus maintain a high standard. German universities also do not rely on students’ tuition fees, so they are under no pressure to pass them. Professors don’t care to fail an entire class as long as there is nothing wrong with the questions.

8. What Are TU9 Universities in Germany?

TU9 is the alliance of leading Institutes of Technology in Germany: RWTH Aachen University, TU Berlin, TU Braunschweig, TU Darmstadt, TU Dresden, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, TU München, University of Stuttgart.

The TU9 Universities are excellent in research: According to the Federal Statistical Office, TU9 members attract a fourth of all third-party funding. In the DFG ranking for research funding in engineering, the TU9 Universities are to be found in the top groups. Nationwide 57 percent of all doctorates in engineering are awarded at TU9 Universities.

Furthermore, TU9 Universities successfully implemented the German government’s Excellence Initiative. RWTH Aachen University (2012, 2007), TU Dresden (2012), Universität Karlsruhe (TH) (now Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 2006) and TU München (2012, 2007) were awarded the status of “University of Excellence.”

9. How Difficult Is the German Educational System?

The initial difficulty students encounter in Germany is trying to understand the system, the exam pattern, and what professors look for in a student during an examination.

Lectures are usually conceptual. The concepts of the subjects will be introduced to you. You will normally get the scripts or notes from the professors, but you cannot rely solely on these scripts to pass examinations. Questions asked during examinations are more application-oriented. Just knowing the concept is not enough. You need to know the subjects well enough to apply the concepts to real-life problems.

10. What Is the Difference Between Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences?

In short, Universities of Applied Sciences or Fachhochschules are practically oriented, whereas Universities are research-oriented. Almost all Universities of Applied Sciences have a compulsory practical semester that students must undertake. Another important point is that doctorate degrees are usually offered only by Universities. However, some Fachhochschules have been legally allowed to offer doctorate degrees in conjunction with a partner university or a research institute.

11. Are There Scholarships Available at German Universities?

German universities do not generally charge tuition fees, which is in itself a form of scholarship. However, they provide some funds which cater to students’ living expenses since the cost of living is quite high in Germany. You can find more information about the various scholarships by visiting the scholarship database of DAAD.

12. Are There Any Age Limits to Applying to Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programmes in Germany?

No, there is no age limit to applying to study programs in Germany. In fact, Germany is known to have a reputation for having the continent's oldest graduates—on average, 28 years old.

13. What Are the Typical Times to Apply for Admission to German Universities and Their Deadlines?

Most German universities have two main application periods. One is in the summer semester, and the other is in the winter semester. The summer semester usually starts around April 1, and students must submit their applications by January 15 since it can take quite some time between receiving your admission letter and processing your student visa. The winter semester usually starts around October 1, and students are usually required to submit their applications latest by July 15.

14. How Do I Convert My Grades to the German Grading System?

You should use the following equation if your bachelor’s degree was obtained in a country other than Germany.

GR = 3 * [(GRmax - GRd) / (GRmax - GRmin)] + 1

GR = the GPA you're looking for, converted GPA (German)
GRmax = highest possible grade in the non-German grading system, expressed in numbers
GRd = grade earned in the non-German grading system.
GRmin = lowest possible passing grade in the non-German grading system (i.e. the lowest possible grade that would still allow you to pass the course)

Please, after you have obtained your converted GPA (German), round it to one decimal place.

Special cases:

- If the system works with percentage, please just use the number without the % sign in the equation.

- If the system works with letters, please just convert the letters into numbers.

Example:

A = 5
B = 4
C = 3
D = 2
E = 1
F = 0 (fail)


GRmax = 5
GRmin = last grade to pass = 1

GRd = your grade point average, e.g.
A+A+B+C = 5+5+4+3 = 17
GRd = 17:4 = 4.25

The resulting equation would be:
GR = 3 * [(5 - 4.25) / (5 - 1)] + 1 = 3 * 0.75/4 + 1 = 0.562 + 1 = 1.562


--> Rounding to one decimal place --> your "new" GPA would be 1.6

Please keep in mind: The German system recognizes grades from 1.0 (best)
to 4.0 (lowest possible passing grade) - so the result should be within this range.

15. Do German Universities Recognize Credit Transfers From Previous Universities?

Prior periods of study and related examinations and coursework, which were completed in an identical programme of study (full or partial) at a university that is subject to the Basic Law of Germany, shall be recognized officially and fully without an equivalence assessment. A “period of study” is defined as any evaluated and documented component of a degree programme at a German university. While not equivalent to a full programme of study, it nevertheless constitutes a significant acquisition of knowledge or skill.


16. What Happens if I Fail at a German University?

In most German universities, you usually have three chances for each exam. After failing the third time, you have to leave the university, and you can never study anything related to your study program. Failing a paper might mean two things. One is sitting down for a paper and actually failing it. The second is not showing up for an exam without a suitable excuse. An example of a suitable excuse is being sick.


17. What Is ‘Studienkolleg’?

It is a one-year preparatory course that has to be joined by individual candidates who wish to study at a German higher education institution but whose school-leaving diploma is deemed insufficient to apply for a degree program.

The course covers full-time education in the subjects of a degree program and the German language for five days a week. A passing score on the final Assessment Examination qualifies you to apply for a degree program suitable for you at any German university.


18. What Is Abitur?

Abitur is a university-preparatory school leaving qualification conferred to students who pass their final exams at the end of their secondary education, usually after twelve or thirteen years of schooling. As a matriculation examination, Abitur can be compared to A-level, Matura, or the International Baccalaureate Diploma, which are ranked as level 4 in the European Qualifications Framework. The high school diploma from most countries is usually not equivalent to the German Abitur. You should therefore check with your university if the high school diploma from your country is the equivalent of the Abitur.


19. Can I Study in the German Language as an International Student?

Yes. There is no restriction on the language of study for international students. Of course, if you would like to study in German, then your German language should be very good. Most German-taught programs require a minimum of B2 and prefer C1 to ensure smooth studies.


20. What Level of Knowledge of the German Language Do I Need to Attend a ‘Studienkolleg’?

You should have a minimum German language level of B1 in order to be admitted to ‘Studienkolleg’.

21. Do I Need to Show Some Proof of German if My Program Is Taught Completely in English?

If your course is taught completely in English, then there is no need to show any proof of the German language. However, it is advisable to have some basic knowledge of German to cope with everyday life in Germany.


22. Is GRE and IELTS or TOEFL Mandatory for Master’s Programs in Germany?

Most German universities do not place much emphasis on GRE scores. Few universities will request you have a particular score on the GRE, but most German universities do not consider GRE scores. They rather place a huge emphasis on your previous academic records. Most German universities base 80% of the admission decision on previous academic records and the remaining 20% on other factors like your motivation letter and work experience.


If you are from native English-speaking countries like the USA, Canada, or Australia, there is no need to write IELTS or TOEFL. Some universities would waive these tests if your bachelor’s degree was in English, but there are very few. Most German universities will insist you provide them with IELTS or TOEFL if your program of study is in English. Therefore, students who want to study in Germany should write IELTS or TOEFL just to be on the safe side. Some Embassies might also request IELTS or TOEFL scores if your program is in English. Most universities require an overall minimum of 6 in IELTS Academic and a minimum TOEFL score of 80 (internet-based).


23. I Keep Hearing of Uni-Assist. What Is This?

Uni-assist checks if your document fulfills the general requirements for a university course of study in Germany. Uni-assist performs this preliminary check on behalf of all its universities. For this purpose, you send uni-assist all the documents requested by the university. Uni-assist will usually require you to pay for the preliminary check performed on your documents.


24. How Do I Apply for a PhD in Germany?

If you have a degree that qualifies you for a doctoral program in Germany, you first need to find an academic supervisor/mentor (the “Doktorvater” or “Doktormutter” in German) who will guide you through the research phase leading to the writing of your dissertation.

There are many ways of finding an academic supervisor in Germany. One way is through personal contacts your professors may have in Germany. Another way is through online research of various scientific publications.

Once you find an academic supervisor, you have to enroll in a university program for several semesters, where you will gain scientific experience and work as an assistant, all the while researching and writing your dissertation.

25. What Qualification Do I Need to Be Admitted to a PhD Programme in Germany?

The most important formal qualification for beginning a Ph.D. in Germany is a very good higher education degree recognized in Germany. Generally, a minimum of eight semesters of academic study is required, and the degree must be equivalent to a German Master's. Decisions on recognizing earlier periods of study lie solely with the individual German higher education institution. You can also be admitted to the so-called fast track program if you have a bachelor's degree. However, you must be extremely talented to make it into this program.


26. What Types of PhDs Are Available in Germany?

There are two types of PhDs available in Germany. The first type is the individual doctorate. It is the most popular type of Ph.D. You will be required to work independently and will produce your dissertation under the supervision of a professor. You will have a great deal of flexibility with this option, but it demands a high level of personal discipline on your part. The second type is structured Ph.D. programs. Here, doctoral students work in groups and are guided by a group of supervisors.


top-50-most-asked-questions-about-studying-in-germany
27. Can I Stay in Germany After Completing My Studies?

Yes. Students are given 18 months to find a job in a field closely related to what they studied after completing their studies. Your stay in Germany is dependent on your ability to secure a job in a relevant field within these 18 months. If you are successful in securing an offer of a qualified job, you can apply for a residence permit for qualified employment or an EU Blue Card. Except for the EU Blue Card, your job does not necessarily have to be related to your professional qualifications. However, if you want to work in a regulated profession you will need a licence to practise.

Even if you fail to secure a job during the 18 months and return home, you have the option of returning to Germany again in the future (usually after a year) with the Chancenkarte (“opportunity card”). With your degree or vocational training from Germany, you will automatically qualify for the Opportunity Card or Chancenkarte from your home country. All you need to do is demonstrate financial means of at least €12,324 or an employment contract for part-time work. The Opportunity Card is issued for a period of up to one year and allows you to take part-time jobs for up to 20 hours a week and two-week trial jobs. If you find qualified employment during your stay, you can obtain a subsequent residence permit for the purpose of further searching (follow-up Opportunity Card) or taking up gainful employment from the local foreigners authority in Germany.

28. How Do I Apply for a German Student Visa?

The first and probably the most important document you need to apply for a student visa is an admission letter. This is to provide proof that you have been admitted to a German university. You can visit the website of the German embassy of your country and take a look at their student visa requirements, as this differs from country to country. Most Embassies require students to open a blocked account to show proof of finance.

29. What Is the Difference Between a Language Visa and a Student Visa?

A student visa is issued if you have applied for a German university study course and received the admission letter. On the other hand, a language course visa is issued if you wish to do a language course in Germany. The visa or residence permit for language acquisition is issued for the duration of the language course, up to a maximum of 12 months. During this time, you are permitted to work up to 20 hours per week.

30. What Are the Typical Documents for a Student Visa Application?

The following documents are generally requested in most student visa applications:

passport pictures
birth certificate
admission letter
transcripts and university degrees earned
proof of previous and current employment, internships, practical attachments
motivation letter
sponsor’s passport, information/proof on relation to sponsor, a motivation of sponsorship
proof of adequate financial means to cover the university fees, housing, the cost of living, and other expenses, 853 euros (from 1 January 2020) for every month of the first academic year.
31. What Are the Ways to Prove Financial Support at the German Embassy?

Students need to be financially sound to survive in Germany. The German embassy places a huge emphasis on the financial capability of students. There are three main ways students can prove sufficient financial means.

The first and most common one is through the opening of a blocked account. Students are expected to fund this account with 11,208 euros every year for the duration of their studies.

The second is the formal obligation according to §§ 66 to 68 of the German Residence Act (signed by a person living in Germany at the local immigration office in Germany and confirmed by the immigration office). The formal obligation should specifically state that the sponsorship covers studies and mention the duration of the intended sponsorship. The formal obligation is only suited as adequate proof of finance with the remark “Die finanzielle Leistungsfähigkeit des/der Verpflichtungserklärenden wurde nachgewiesen.” (The financial capability of the sponsor has been verified.)

The third is through scholarships from German public funds or scholarships financed by an organization that promotes education and is approved in Germany. Scholarships from the applicant’s country of origin are also accepted by the public funds.

32. What Is a Blocked Account?

A blocked account is exactly what the name implies. It is an account that limits the amount of money you can withdraw at a given point in time. The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) has estimated the average cost of living for students to be around 842 euros per month. To ensure students don’t run into any financial burden once in Germany, one of the ways to show financial proof is by opening a blocked account. Students are required to open an account in Germany and transfer 11,208 euros into it. Once they arrive in Germany, they can gain access to this account. However, they cannot withdraw more than €934 monthly from this account.

33. How Do I Open a Blocked Account?

You can only open a blocked account once you have gotten an admission letter. Some Embassies require you to open the blocked account before the interview. Others will tell you not to open the blocked account until you have completed your interview. The German Embassy collaborates mainly with Deutsche Bank for the opening of blocked accounts. However, recently, it has started collaborating with other banks, such as Ecobank. Since Deutsche Bank is the most widely recognized bank for opening blocked accounts in Germany, that is what we would be dealing with it.

The first step in opening a blocked account is to take the following documents to the embassy and have them certified:

Completed application form for opening a blocked bank account from the official website of Deutsche Bank
Valid passport
A copy of the course admission letter from your university/language school
A prepaid envelope (from a private service provider such as FedEx, DHL, or UPS)
The completed, certified, and signed application form will be sent to the following address by a German embassy/consulate:

Deutsche Bank Privat- und Geschäftskunden AG Alter Wall 53 20457 Hamburg Germany

After the account has been opened, you have to transfer the minimum balance and service fee to your new account at Deutsche Bank. Deutsche bank will send your IBAN and BIC to your e-mail address or registered postal address once the account has been opened.

As soon as the money has been received, you will automatically be informed by e-mail.

Upon arriving in Germany, please visit a branch of Deutsche Bank and fill in a service order (application to activate the blocked account for international students). Take a valid passport with you to the branch.

34. What Happens to My Money in My Blocked Account if My Visa Ends up Getting Refused?

If you are not granted a visa to enter Germany, Deutsche bank will need the following documents to transfer the balance back to you:

Lifting of the block by the beneficiary of the blocked account or original letter stating that your visa application was unsuccessful.
Signed application to close the account (must be completed in full and signed)
Please send these original documents (an e-mail or fax is not acceptable) to the following address: Deutsche Bank Privat- und Geschäftskunden AG Alter Wall 53 20457 Hamburg Germany.

35. Is the Interview at the German Embassy Tough?

The visa interview always seems to be the scariest part of the visa process for students, but this shouldn’t be the case. The fact that your university has offered you admission means they believe you are in good academic standing to pursue your desired program.

The main aim of the visa interview is to confirm whether you are in the right state of mind and are motivated enough to study in Germany. Being academically sound is only a small fraction of the total package that students should possess to succeed abroad. You can find out more about the likely student visa interview questions with answers by clicking here.

36. What Is Health Insurance in Germany and Why Do Students Require It?

In Germany, you will usually not get a residence permit without proof of adequate insurance. Health insurance is mandatory for all students in Germany, so you will not be able to start working or studying without it. Since 1 January 2009, anyone resident in Germany is required to possess health insurance coverage from a provider licensed in Germany.

Health insurance is usually paid on a monthly basis. For students, you will need to register and provide your bank account details to your health insurance company once you arrive in Germany. Universities usually assist students with this during the enrollment process. Your health insurance company will withdraw a specified amount from your bank account every month.

37. What Documents Do I Need for Enrollment at My University Once I Arrive in Germany?

The following documents are usually needed for enrollment:

your notification of admission
proof of valid health insurance (your university will assist you in getting this)
your passport with valid visa and passport pictures
original documents you used in your application, like transcripts and bachelors certificates
receipt of payment of semester contribution fees
38. How Do I Apply for and Extend My Residence Permit Once in Germany?

According to Make-it-in-Germany.com, a German residence permit allows you to stay in Germany for a more extended period than only 90 days. Residence permits are given for students who will be completing an undergraduate, graduate, or vocational degree in Germany. After they finish their degree, students can extend their temporary permit for another 18 months to find a job in Germany.

Once students arrive in Germany, they are expected to apply for a residence permit with the respective Immigration Office responsible for their country. The first and most important step that students must undertake once they arrive in Germany is registering their address with the Citizens´ Services Office (Bürgerservice/Einwohnermeldeamt). Typically, their personal data will be transferred to the Immigration Office within a few days after registration.

Some immigration offices initially give students a two-year residence permit. Others give students a one-year residence permit. You must always have a valid residence permit during your stay in Germany. As a rule, this permit can be extended as long as your purpose of stay is still valid. Most immigration offices require you to show 11,208 euros (from 1 January 2024) in a blocked account to have your permit extended again. Others will accept your work contract and monthly payslips if you successfully secure a part-time job.

Depending on the amount of money you earn from your part-time work as a student, you might still have to show a certain amount of money in your blocked account. For instance, if you earn 538 euros per month, you will be required to show 4752 euros in a blocked account in addition to your work contract and payslips in order to have your residence permit extended.



39. Why Was My German Student Visa Rejected?

It can be really frustrating if your student visa gets rejected. However, students need to understand that there is no guarantee they will be granted a visa even if every aspect of their application is perfect. The most common reasons that cause students' visas to be rejected are poor financial status, insufficient language level, poor academic profile, inconsistency with the choice of the study program, and lack of preparation for your interview. You can get an in-depth explanation of the various reasons for the rejection of German student visas by clicking here.

40. What Do I Do if My Student Visa Ends up Getting Rejected?

There are two options you can take. You can either appeal or reapply. If you think the refusal decision was unfair and your circumstances merit reconsideration. Then you can go ahead and appeal the decision. If, however, you believe you stand a better chance now than the last time you were denied because of a change in your circumstances which may be that you have applied for a new study program, improved your IELTS score, or have adequately prepared for the interview this time around, then it’s best to reapply.

41. What Are Some of the Likely Challenges I Might Encounter as an International Student in Germany?

Studying in Germany is not as rosy as most educational consultancies portray it. These consultancies present Germany to students as a country with streets of gold where they can be assured of a perfect life. With these lies in their heads, students become shocked and frustrated when they come to terms with the realities on the ground. Such frustration has even led some students to commit suicide.

Some common problems you are likely to encounter in Germany are the language barrier, problems securing accommodation, performance demand from your study course, problem securing part-time jobs, and problems adjusting to the German educational system and culture.

42. Would I Be Allowed to Work While Studying in Germany?

International students who do not come from the EU or EEA can work 140 full or 280 half days a year. If you want to work more than 140 full or 280 half days, you need the approval of the Employment Agency and the Aliens Department.

The legally allowed number of working days (half days) for international students also includes voluntary work placements, regardless of whether the placement is paid or unpaid. Also, international students face an additional restriction: while working the legally allowed number of days (or half days), they cannot be self-employed or work freelance.

43. Can I Find a Part-Time Job in Germany and How Much Can I Earn?

Most prospective students are really concerned if they can be able to find a part-time job to support themselves. There is no sure answer to this question as it depends on many factors. The first and most important factor is your ability to speak good German. It will be very difficult to secure a job if you don’t speak any German.

Another important factor is the city where you live. If your school is located in a big city like Berlin, there is a high chance you might find something compared to a smaller town. Don’t expect to earn much as a student unless you want to forfeit your studies which can get you into trouble. What you will earn from part-time jobs will just be enough to take care of basic living expenses. You will have to pay taxes if your monthly payment exceeds 538 euros. Germany's minimum wage is €12.41 per hour, pre-tax since 1 January 2024.

Companies like Daimler and Amazon offer seasonal jobs to students during the holidays. Students can use this to earn extra cash during their semester breaks.

44. My Spouse Plans to Accompany Me to Germany. Would He or She Be Allowed to Work?

Spouses who accompany international students may be allowed to work under certain circumstances. Spouses of international students who plan on accompanying them and hope they will be allowed to work must fully disclose their intention when applying for the visa.

45. Will I Be Liable to Pay Taxes in Germany?

The two main factors that determine whether you will be liable to pay tax are the amount of money you’ve earned working and the duration of your stay in Germany. You are generally excluded from having to pay taxes if your stay in Germany doesn’t exceed six months and if you make less than €450 per month (considered to be income from a so-called “mini-job” and therefore tax and pension contribution exempt) working in Germany. If your annual gross income is less than €8,130, you will get all the taxes you paid refunded back to you at the end of the year when you file your tax return with tax authorities.

46. Can I Bring My Wife or Children to Germany While Studying There?

Family reunification is possible if you have a residence permit in Germany and also if the duration of your study will take longer than one year. However, you must prove that you can support them without burdening social assistance in any way for you to be allowed to bring them to Germany.

47. What Exactly Is a Studentenwerk?

Studentenwerk is an organization that acts in the interest of the students of each particular region in Germany. Each German region has its own studentenwerk, but they cooperate closely on the national level. Studentenwerk generally organizes and runs cafeterias, restaurants, housing units, the BAföG for the government, and even psychological and low-level health services. Some regions and universities mandate a certain yearly fee for each student for the studentenwerk, making it legally a very close cooperation between the semi-independent organization and the local governments.

48. Can I Do a “Duales Studium” as a Foreigner?

Most universities in Germany offer the so-called “Duales Studium.” This special way of studying makes it possible for students to study theory at a traditional university and, at the same time, practice what they have learned at companies that partner with the university or program.

Depending on your visa, you will most likely be able, as a foreigner, to work only 120 days out of the year. As long as this is in agreement with your university’s program, you can participate in the highly successful Dual Studium program.

49. Will My Driver’s License Be Valid in Germany?

The validity of foreign driver’s licenses is usually limited to six months. If your driver’s license expires after six months as a full-time student with a residence permit in Germany, the only way for you to continue to drive legally would be to transfer your license. The country of issuance of your driver’s license will determine whether transferring your license will require you to undergo the theoretical and driving tests administered by driving schools in Germany. You can find out more about what regulations apply to your home country by contacting the local dept. of motor vehicles/driver’s licenses.

Transferring your driver’s license in Germany will require you to provide the following documents:

Your original driver’s license (has to still be valid),
Passport-size photograph of you,
Proof of residency in Germany and
Your passport or ID card.

50. How Can I Find Accommodation Once I Arrive in Germany?

Finding accommodation as a new student in Germany can be quite tough, depending on the city where you find yourself. In big cities like Munich, finding accommodation can be a huge headache, and most of the rooms you might come across can be relatively expensive. Some universities provide accommodation to students. It is therefore important to check with your university first if they offer accommodation since university accommodations are quite cheaper.


If you cannot find accommodation through this means, you can search online. One of the most popular sites for searching for accommodation in Germany is WG. New rooms are advertised daily on this site, and you can secure a room if you are persistent.

If possible, do not arrive late at night since you can end up being stranded. If you still don´t have a flat after you arrive in Germany, please go as soon as possible to the Studentenwerk. They often have emergency accommodation available at the beginning of the term.


Questions & Answers

Question: What’s your take on studying in English versus studying in German as an undergraduate student while in Germany?

Answer: It depends on your long term goal. If your goal is to stay and work in Germany after completing your studies, then it would be wise to study in German as this would definitely help you master the language. Of course, you will also need to master German to a certain level in your home country before you are even admitted to study a program that is taught in German. There have been cases of students who have been able to master German whilst they were studying in English but generally it’s quite difficult.


Question: How much do the private universities in Germany cost for engineering? Are there public universities that teach engineering in English? If I am supposed to be taught in German, and I don’t understand it, do I have to apply for a language course and then come back to Nigeria to apply for a student visa?

Answer: The tuition fees at private universities in Germany range from a few hundred euros to several thousands of euros.


Yeah, there are a lot of public universities that teach engineering in English in Germany.

First and foremost, if you are going to study at a university in German, then you must prove that you have sufficient knowledge of German at the Embassy to be granted a student visa. No university will give you an admission letter to study in German if you don't understand German.


Also, you can't just apply to a language course for instance like A1 and expect to be granted a language visa considering that there is a Goethe Institute in Nigeria that also offers A1. It is advisable to study German in Nigeria to a respectable level like B1 before applying for a language course in Germany.

Normally, most language courses are part of the requirement to pursue a degree program in German. Hence, once you have successfully completed the German language course, you can go ahead and start with your degree program and apply for the switch from language visa to a student visa in Germany. You don't need to return to Nigeria to apply all over again.

Question: I recently applied for a German student visa at the German Embassy in Sri Lanka. It is stated on their website that the visa process takes about three months. I applied on the 3rd of May, and still, haven’t heard from them. I called the Embassy yesterday, and they informed me that the entire process could take more than three months. My university is located in Dortmund, and their enrollment deadline is in September. Is there a way to accelerate the visa process?

Answer: Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do than wait for a decision. The first thing I would have suggested you do was to call the embassy which you have already done. The visa process usually takes three months, but it can take more than that for one reason or the other.

Another option you can take is to ask your school to contact the immigration office in your university town to inquire about the status of your visa. However, this will have very little effect in accelerating the visa process since they hardly give priority to any one application.

I understand that awaiting a visa decision can be nerve-wracking, but I will advise you just to relax and wait for the decision. If you haven't heard anything by the end of August, try to contact the embassy again. Also, ask your university if it is possible to extend your enrollment deadline. All the best.

Question: I applied for a student visa two weeks ago. During the interview, the consular told me I’d get my passport in two months. Assuming the Embassy intends to reject my visa, will they inform me earlier (around 1-3 weeks) or later (around two to three months) of their decision? Does the fact that the consular told me I’d get my passport in two months mean my student visa will be most likely approved?

Answer: There is no standard period that the German Embassy takes to reject student visas. Some students will have their visas rejected just a few weeks after their visa interview. Others will get notified after several months. If you receive an email asking you to come for your documents and they don't mention anything about a travel insurance, then you can be 90% sure your student visa has been rejected.

Question: I just received a conditional offer letter from TU Ilmenau University. The first condition is I have to do a preparatory course and give an aptitude test once I arrive in Germany. The second condition has to do with my IELTS score. I scored 5.5 on my IELTS, which didn’t satisfy the university’s requirement. The university offered me the option of taking and passing an English test once I arrive in Germany. What are my chances, and should I apply for the visa or not with these conditions?

Answer: Honestly, I can't tell you the chance of securing a visa with your conditions since there are a whole lot of other factors involved. Securing an admission letter, even if it's a conditional admission letter, tells the Embassy the university believes you are fit to pursue their degree program.

Your IELTS score is a little low. However, your university has offered you the chance to retake it in Germany. The question the Embassy will ask themselves is what is the guarantee you will get the required score if granted a visa.

So you should weigh the options and decide if it's worth it to apply. I can't decide for you. In case, you decide to apply, work extensively on your motivation letter. Explain in your motivation letter why you had a low score in IELTS and convince them you will get a higher IELTS score and pass your aptitude test if given a visa to study in Germany.

Question: Have you ever heard of a study visa (university) being rejected because the student's family owns a house in Germany? A Chinese client of mine has suggested that this happened to a friend of his, but it sounds incorrect.

Answer: I think it is highly unlikely. I don't think a student's family owning a house in Germany will have any outcome on his or her visa.

Question: I will be arriving in Berlin by the end of this year to start with my language course. I have a friend who has started his first year of bachelors here (in India). I've come across people saying that there's an option to apply for universities in Germany directly after finishing your first year in your home country, but there isn’t much info about this on the net. Can you elaborate more on this?

Answer: With a high school diploma and a year of study at a university (or 2 years sometimes), you can gain admission directly to a university in Germany since the high school diploma from most countries is not equivalent to the Abitur in Germany.

Question: A friend of mine told me that the interviewer will ask if you want to answer the questions in German or English. She said that this is a trick question and you should always opt to answer in German. If not, there is a high chance your visa would be rejected. Is this true? Is it okay if one gives the interview in English or should they answer in German (for a student visa)?

Answer: There is no evidence that students who answer their interview questions in German are highly likely to secure their student visas than those who answer in English. If your programme is taught completely in English, the interviewer will expect the interview to be in English. Same way if you are going for a German taught programme; the interviewer will expect the interview to be in German.

Question: What document am I required to submit to show English language proficiency for the visa application? My course will be taught in English. All of my previous education has been in English, and this was sufficient for my university admission process in Germany.

Answer: It is always advisable to take IELTS or TOEFL just to be safe, especially if you are not from a native English speaking country like USA, UK, Canada, Australia or New Zealand. This is because there have been a lot of cases where applicants couldn’t score a 6.0 in IELTS which is the minimum score for most English-taught programs in Germany despite all their previous education being in English.

If your university accepted that all your previous education was in English and waived IELTS or TOEFL, then I think that is enough. The embassy might only require a letter from your university and previous educational institutions stating your education was entirely in English and as such do not require IELTS or TOEFL. However, if during the interview, they realize that your level of English is inferior even though all your previous education was in English, it can lead to your visa being rejected.

Question: I applied for my student visa with my mother's financial records because she is the one that is paying for my stay here in Germany. I have a six months visa, so I need to extend it. Do I need to show money again for the extension?

Answer: To extend your visa, you must show the money again at the Immigration office.

Question: How do you think I can justify a second masters degree if the VO happen to bring it up during the interview?

Answer: Below is a good example given by a student for going for a second master's degree.

"I initially applied for my dream Ph.D. program at TU-Munich. However, I was denied admission on the basis that I lacked sufficient course content and research in my master's degree. I, therefore, decided to apply for another master's degree to get the necessary course content and research experience to apply for my dream Ph.D. program at TU-Munich."

Question: Does the consular go to prospective students schools to verify their results and transcripts?

Answer: Some embassies might do that if they spot some inconsistencies in your application. Anyway, if you have a genuine application, there is nothing to be afraid of.

Question: I am a Bsc Microbiology Student (6 semesters) in India. I want to apply to the IMPRS MarMic course in Bremen, Germany. The last date of application is February 28th whereas my final semester exam would be in March/April. Can I send an application to the university with transcripts of only five semesters?

Answer: The best thing will be to email the school and ask them if it's possible. Some German universities require you to have your complete transcripts and degree certificate at the time of application. Others can accept partial transcripts on the condition that you will present your complete transcripts and degree certificate during enrollment.

I applied for a german student visa and unfortunately I have only five weeks to enroll at my university since I couldn't secure an early visa appointment. Initially, I had only 3 weeks to enroll but the embassy asked me to request for extension of which the university agreed and gave me an additional 2 weeks.

Do you think I will get the visa on time?

Zayn on June 26, 2019:

I done my visa interview for study in Germany few days ago , visa officer asked me only few questions, like how many semester , credits, previous academic background, results , future plans , ielts score, and I answerd the question properly. but the problem is when visa officer asked me about my accommodation, I did mistakes ,and he doubt me and told me to submit the accommodation documents that I booked there. And some mistakes on my health insurance certificate, and he said me to extend the health insurance date . So now my question is this mistakes can lead me in the visa rejection?

Ruturaj Chavan on May 07, 2019:

It has been 62 days now since I gave my Visa Interview. I know it may take time but my language classes have already started. I tried to email the consulate but I not got a reply. Also tried calling them but all efforts on vain. They pick up the call and no one replies on the phone. Just worried. What can I do in this situation?

Didi on January 04, 2019:

Hello, I received a conditional admission offer, and the condition s include obtaining min 20 week's work experience through internship in my related program and also obtaining an additional 30ECTS, both of which should be done during the masters program. The letter also stated that I could acheiveh both by taking an exchange semester. My question is will these conditions affect my Visa application?

Raisa Gomes on June 25, 2018:

Hi, I am applying for a Student visa to Germany from the Mumbai Consulate. I will be funding my education through an education loan taken from my bank based in India.

Will a copy of my loan sanction letter suffice as financial proof for my application?

Or is it required that the bank be based in Germany?

Hassan on August 26, 2017:

Thanks

It's really helpful.

Stay Blessed.

Top universities in Germany - how to find the best one for you
woman sitting with her laptop on her legs looking for something
The question about the top universities in Germany is one of those that we are asked most frequently by international students. If you are studying abroad, you also want to make the best choice, logically! Unfortunately, this is not so easy to answer as there are a lot of different criteria by which universities can be evaluated - and they are always subjective factors. Therefore, we would like to give you only a short introduction to the topic in the following section.
International rankings: approx. 50 German universities in the top 500
Germany is among the top 3 nations in the major international university rankings. For example, if you look at the top 200 in THE World University Ranking, you will find 23 German universities and other institutions of higher education just behind the USA (60 universities in the top 200) and the UK (28 universities in the top 200). Germany thus occupies 3rd place in the nation's ranking. The top 20 universities in Germany are the following:
Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
Technical University of Munich.
Heidelberg University.
University of Bonn.
Humboldt University of Berlin.
Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
University of Freiburg.
University of Tübingen.
RWTH Aachen University.
Goethe University Frankfurt.
University of Göttingen.
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
Free University of Berlin.
University of Hamburg.
Ulm University.
Technical University of Berlin.
University of Cologne.
University of Münster.
Technical University of Dresden.
University of Mannheim.
In contrast to the Anglo-Saxon countries, the internationally ranked German universities are almost exclusively public universities. You will not find universities of applied sciences or private universities in the international rankings (apart from individual subject rankings) - which is mainly due to the fact that the rankings are primarily based on research output and reputation.
 
They say little or sometimes nothing about the quality of teaching. In this respect, you should not overestimate the rankings. Even German universities that do not appear in international rankings generally offer a very high-quality study program. This is because quality standards apply to all universities in Germany and are set by the state.
National rankings
Compared to other countries, Germany does not have a very pronounced ranking culture. Putting universities on a ranking list on the basis of quantitative metrics is (rightly) viewed critically by many. This is because it is almost always a very abbreviated description of what universities achieve and offer to individual students. However, due to the high volume of requests we receive from students, you can find the top nationally-ranked German universities on our StudyFinder as well.

The 3 types of universities in Germany

Type of University
(German Translation)	Degrees Offered	Subject-range	Focus	Official Degrees Issued
University
(Universität)	Bachelor, master, Staatsexamen, and Ph.D.	In general all subjects
(incl. state-regulated professions such as medicine, law, pharmacy, teaching).	More academic setting, research-oriented.	Yes.
University of Applied Science
(Fachhochschule / Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften)	Bachelor and master.	Applicable subjects
(engineering, business, social sciences, etc).
 	Rather practical orientation than research.	Yes.
Colleges of Art and Music
(Kunst- und Musikhochschulen)	Bachelor and master.	Fine arts, music, dance, etc.	Practical training.	Yes.
 

Public vs. private universities (and why each has its pros & cons)
a guy comparing two green apples
The German education system is (in contrast to other countries) traditionally characterized by public universities. This is because education in Germany is a public good that is paid for by the state. Therefore, studying in Germany is basically free of charge - even for international students. Private universities are therefore still a relatively new phenomenon in the German university landscape.
 
While some of the large state universities have a tradition that goes back centuries (e.g. Heidelberg University founded in 1386), private universities have only existed in Germany since the 1980s. Even though the private sector has been booming in the last ten years, public universities continue to dominate:
 
about 90% of all students study at public universities,
about 18,000 of the 20,000 courses of study (90%!) are offered by public universities,
all top German universities in the three major international rankings (THE, Shanghai, QS) are public universities.
 
Nevertheless, there are also many reasons why students still choose a private university. Before we cover the advantages of both types of study institutions, we will first illustrate their differences in an overview below.
 	Public Universities	Private Universities
Total no. of Institutions	316	143
In the Top International Rankings	Approx. 28-50 (depending on ranking).	0 (but a few in the subjects rankings e.g. MBA).
Famous Examples	Humboldt University of Berlin, Free University of Berlin, Heidelberg University, Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich.	EBS, Witten-Herdecke, WHU, Jacobs University Bremen,  Bucerius Law School, Hertie School of governance.
% of Students in Germany	Approx. 90%.	Approx. 10%.
No. of Study Programs	Bachelors: 7,914.
Masters: 8,759.
Staatsexamen: 1,203.	Bachelors: 1,018.
Masters: 715.
No. of Master’s in English	1,164.	183.
Tuition Fees	Generally tuition-free*.	Average of 2,000 - 4,000 € per semester.
 

* Non-EU students in Baden-Württemberg (1,500 € per semester); special master programs (e.g. MBA, LLM).

Pros and cons
Students seek out study programs in Germany for many reasons, but a great attraction is that programs at public universities in Germany are free. While this is the main pull for many students, there are many benefits to attending private universities in Germany. If you have had your eye on a private institution in Germany but are reluctant due to the tuition fees, let’s break down your options below and see if a private university is meant for you! Below we have listed a pros and cons list for each type of university, public and private, with three points for each section. While you shouldn’t let one con prevent you from applying to your dream study program, having a bigger picture can sometimes help you make the decision.
Public Universities	Private Universities
Free Tuition: 

The most well-known factor which attracts students to public universities in Germany is free tuition. At public universities in Germany, with the exception of some specialized executive master’s programs, there is no tuition for students, including non-EU international students.

Specializations:

Private business schools, law schools, medical schools, and more! Attending a private university can mean that your program has a specialized focus which can be beneficial for many students looking to more specific study programs such as law, business, and medicine.

The full range of course options:

Depending on your program requirements, students can enroll in a variety of different courses on many different subject areas which are offered by the university as an elective course, parallel to their study program. Some may be in English, but if you speak German you can also enroll in German courses!

Innovative study programs:

Some courses are mainly offered by private universities depending on the subject. Some examples are courses in the field of entrepreneurship, digitization, or specialized health topics (e.g. physiotherapy).

Research orientation:

Those who want to gain insights into research during their studies are still best off at public universities. This is where basic research takes place, where Nobel Prize winners also give lectures, or where there is more of a possibility to do a Ph.D.

Available services and facilities:

Private universities have smaller student bodies which means that students may have small classes, expanded access to study facilities (e.g. 24/7 coworking spaces), extra services such as organized accommodation and internships, and have extra chances to network with alumni.

 

Of course, this comparison can only provide a rough overview of the contrast between public and private universities. With a view to the 501 universities in Germany, you should always check each individual program you are interested in - both in terms of the university and the respective degree program because the differences can vary.
Special cases: the universities run by the church(es)
In Germany, there are also theology-focused colleges with different theology based courses of study. Such institutions also offer bachelor’s programs and master’s programs where students can focus on different topics such as theology, care management, education sciences, musicology, health care research, and more! There are also programs in English if you are not yet fluent in German. Take a look here!

Internationally recognized degrees: Bachelor, Master, Ph.D.

A question students frequently ask is how their degree from a German higher education institution will be recognized abroad. The easy answer is: Relax! A degree completed at a German higher education institution is recognized abroad. This is because Germany has been introducing international degrees only since 1999 as part of the so-called Bologna Process.
 
Apart from a few subjects that prepare students for state-regulated professions (such as medicine, law or teaching professions → see special case "Staatsexamen"), Germany offers international degree programs bachelor, master, and Ph.D. In this context, you will sometimes come across the term ECTS points (or simply credit points): This number is an internationally standardized description of academic performance and, in simple terms, amounts to 60 points per academic year.
Degree Type	Standard  Duration	ECTS points	Details
Bachelor	3 - 4 years.	180 - 240.	Three or four-year undergraduate programs.
Master	1 - 2 years.	60 - 120.	Two-year graduate degree programs.
Ph.D.	1 - 3 years.	Not applicable.	The German terms for this level are “Promotion” (doctorate) and “Doktor” (for the title). The duration varies much for each subject. In Humanities it can last even more than 3 years, whereas in Law it’s rather 1-2 years. A special case is Human Medicine where the “Dr. med.” is frequently part of the study (with little research impact).
 

Special case: Staatsexamen (State examination)
In Germany, there are some specialized programs that require students to take a state examination before having an accredited certificate for their studies. Just as law students in the US must pass the Bar Exam after completing their degree in order to practice law, students in Germany must enroll in a Staatsexamen (State Exam) degree program. Staatsexamen courses are considered to be undergraduate studies.
 
State exams are required for courses of study that prepare students for state-regulated professions in medicine (human medicine, dentistry, veterinary, etc.), pharmacology, law, and teaching. In addition to the state examination, there are also a few other older degrees (Diplom, Magister), but these are only offered in some subjects or federal states. If you are interested in such degree programs, be aware that you will need to enroll in a Staatsexamen degree program.
Language of instruction: German or English (as you prefer)

Most courses of study continue to be held in German (approx. 18,000 out of 20,000 courses of study). In recent years, however, the range of English-language degree programs at the various levels has grown considerably:
 
Bachelor: more than 300 degree programs in English*.
Master: more than 1,800 courses of study in English*.
Ph.D.: more than 200 graduate schools in English* (the individual doctorate is always possible in English anyway).

*With at least 50% of the course modules taught in English.
 
The only courses of study which are still offered only in German are the state examinations. If you want to become a doctor, judge, teacher, or pharmacist, you can still only do this in German.
 
German universities generally recognize the major English language certificates (IELTS, TOEFL, Cambridge). The required language level (IELTS band, TOEFL score, Cambridge level) is determined individually for each course of study (in contrast to the courses of study in German where there are uniform regulations).
University entrance and applications - the basics you need to know

Universities in Germany have very similar application requirements as other universities abroad. To know the exact admissions requirements for your program of choice, it’s always best to check directly with the admissions office of your preferred university; Germany does not have a general or country-wide admissions policy for their universities and it differs with each program.
 
Generally, you need the following:
A
For graduate programs:
A proof of a bachelor’s degree in a related topic.
A transcript of undergraduate courses and grades with a certain GPA equivalent to the German grading system.
A summary of the bachelor’s or master’s thesis.
B
For all programs:
Proof of proficiency in English or German (TOEFL, TOEIC, or IELTS scores).
A CV or résumé.
A letter of motivation or purpose.
Letter of reference.
C
For Ph.D. or post-docs:
Project summary or outline.
Timeline of research and studies.
Again, keep in mind that the above requirements are general and by no means indicate that every program follows these requirements. It may be the case that you will be asked for additional documents or information. There also may be items listed here which your program will not request. To be sure, check with your top-choice study programs!

7. Do I Need To Open A German Bank Account?
One of the essential financial requirements for many international students planning to study in Germany is the blocked account (Sperrkonto). This account serves as proof that you have sufficient funds to cover your living expenses while studying in Germany. Here’s a detailed look at what a blocked account entails and some known service providers:
What is a Blocked Account?
A blocked account is a special type of bank account where you deposit a specified amount of money, which is then "blocked" or inaccessible to you until you arrive in Germany. This account ensures that you have enough financial resources to support yourself during your stay, as required by the German visa and residency regulations.
Upcoming changes
The recent  update on the official  German Missions in India - Federal Foreign Office website states that:
Expected from 01 September 2024, there will be a change in the necessary amounts to show sufficient financial means:
Applications on and after 01 September 2024 will most likely have to show proof of at least 11,904 euros for the first year, with a maximum withdrawal amount of 992 euros per month
How Does it Work?
Deposit Requirement: Typically, you need to deposit a minimum amount of money into the blocked account, which typically keeps varying. 
Monthly Allowance: While in Germany, you can withdraw a fixed amount each month to cover your living expenses. The remaining balance stays in the account and continues to be blocked.
Proof of Funds: The blocked account statement serves as proof of financial resources when applying for your visa or residence permit.
Known Service Providers for Blocked Accounts:
Several banks and financial institutions offer blocked account services tailored for international students. Some well-known Blocked Account service providers are 
Coracle
ERGO
Dr Walter
Expatrio
Fintiba
8. Do I Need A Student Visa To Study In Germany?
Whether you need a student visa depends on your nationality:
EU/EEA Students: You do not need a visa to study in Germany.
Non-EU/EEA Students: You will need a student visa. This can be a short-stay visa (for courses less than 90 days) or a long-stay visa (for longer courses).

Health Insurance:
Health insurance is compulsory for all students in Germany. There are two main types:
Public Health Insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung): This is available to all students and offers comprehensive coverage. The monthly premium is around €110 for students. Public health insurance is highly recommended due to its wide acceptance and extensive coverage.
Private Health Insurance (Private Krankenversicherung): This is an option for students over 30 or those who choose not to join the public system. Private insurance can be tailored to individual needs, but it’s essential to ensure that the coverage meets the required standards set by the German government.
Some well-known companies providing health insurance for students in Germany include TK (Techniker Krankenkasse), AOK, Barmer, and DAK-Gesundheit.
Travel Insurance:
Travel insurance is also important, especially when you first arrive in Germany. This type of insurance typically covers:
Medical Emergencies: Coverage for unexpected medical expenses during travel.
Trip Cancellation: Reimbursement for non-refundable trip costs if you need to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances.
Lost Luggage: Compensation for lost or damaged luggage.
Travel insurance is essential during your journey to Germany and for any trips you may take outside of Germany during your studies. Some reputable companies offering travel insurance include Coracle, ERGO, and Dr. Walter.
Well-Known Insurance Providers:
Coracle: Specializes in providing insurance solutions for students and expats, including both health and travel insurance.
ERGO: Offers a wide range of insurance products, including travel insurance with comprehensive coverage for international students.
Dr. Walter: Known for tailored insurance plans for students and travelers, covering health, travel, and liability insurance.
